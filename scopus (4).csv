Liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, has been demonstrated to successfully promote weight loss in patients with obesity (OB). Yet, it is unclear whether the observed weight loss is driven by an alteration of food liking. Here we investigated the effects of liraglutide on food liking and the cerebral correlates of liking in OB. Subjects/Methods: This study was a randomized, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, prospective clinical trial. 73 participants with OB and without diabetes following a multidisciplinary weight loss program, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive liraglutide 3.0 mg (37.40 ± 11.18 years old, BMI = 35.89 ± 3.01 kg) or a placebo (40.04 ± 14.10 years old, BMI = 34.88 ± 2.87 kg) subcutaneously once daily for 16 weeks. Interventions/Methods: We investigated liking during food consumption. Participants reported their hedonic experience while consuming a high-calorie food (milkshake) and a tasteless solution. The solutions were administered inside the scanner with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-compatible gustometer to assess neural responses during consumption. The same procedure was repeated during the pre- and post-intervention sessions. Results: None of the effects involving the intervention factor reached significance when comparing liking between the pre- and post-intervention sessions or groups. Liking during food reward consumption was associated with the activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the amygdala. The liraglutide group lost more weight (BMI post-pre = −3.19 ± 1.28 kg/m2) than the placebo group (BMI post-pre = −0.60 ± 1.26 kg/m2). Conclusions: These results suggest that liraglutide leads to weight loss without self-report or neural evidence supporting a concomitant reduction of food liking in participants with OB. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Adult; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prospective Studies; Self Report; Weight Loss; bicarbonate; liraglutide; placebo; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; adult; amygdala; Article; body mass; body weight loss; BOLD signal; cerebellum; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; double blind procedure; environmental temperature; female; follow up; food intake; frontal lobe; functional magnetic resonance imaging; high calorie diet; human; major clinical study; male; Markov chain Monte Carlo method; middle temporal gyrus; milkshake; nerve potential; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; physical activity; putamen; randomized controlled trial; reward; swallowing; taste; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; weight loss program; white matter; middle aged; obesity; prospective study; self report","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168944805"

Body Mass Index (BMI) values >27 kg/m2 are associated with an exponential increase in the risk for Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE). On the other hand, weight reduction can significantly reduce metabolic, CV and oncological risk. Orlistat, bupropion/naltrexone, liraglutide and semaglutide, combined with lifestyle changes, have proven to be effective in weight loss; the last two have been tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with CV outcomes only in diabetic patients, and not in obese patients. To fill a fundamental gap of knowledge, the SELECT trial on patients with obesity and CV disease treated with semaglutide is ongoing, aiming at MACE as the primary endpoint. The battle against the social and clinical stigma towards obesity must be counteracted by promoting an awareness that elevates obesity to a complex chronic disease. Several actions should be implemented to improve the management of obesity, and cardiologists have a key role for achieving a global approach to patients with excess weight also through the correct implementation of available treatment strategies. © 2023 The Authors","Cardiovascular risk; Clinical framework; Obesity; Treatment","Cardiologists; Cardiovascular Diseases; Expert Testimony; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Obesity; Orlistat; Weight Gain; Weight Loss; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; C reactive protein; glucagon like peptide 1; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; interleukin 1; interleukin 18; interleukin 6; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; prostaglandin E2; semaglutide; tetrahydrolipstatin; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; tetrahydrolipstatin; abdominal circumference; Article; atrial fibrillation; body mass; body weight loss; cardiologist; cardiovascular risk; chronic disease; coronary artery disease; diabetic patient; diastolic blood pressure; dyslipidemia; endothelial dysfunction; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; heart failure; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypoglycemia; inflammatory disease; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lifestyle modification; major adverse cardiac event; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; obesity management; physical activity; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk factor; Short Form 36; sleep apnea syndromes; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; body weight gain; cardiovascular disease; complication; expert witness; heart disease risk factor; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152383389"

This study aims to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) + Metformin (Met) versus cyproterone acetate/ethinylestradiol (CPA/EE) + Met in overweight PCOS women and identify potential proteomic biomarkers of disease risk in women with PCOS. Methods: In this prospective, open-label randomized controlled trial, we recruited 60 overweight PCOS women into two groups at a 1:1 ratio to receive CPA/EE (2 mg/day: 2 mg cyproterone acetate and 35-μg ethinylestradiol,) +Met (1500 mg/day) or GLP-1 RA (liraglutide, 1.2–1.8 mg/day) +Met (1500 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The clinical effectiveness and adverse effects were evaluated, followed by plasma proteomic analysis and verification of critical biomarkers by ELISA. Results: Eighty(80%) patients completed the study. Both interventions improved menstrual cycle, polycystic ovaries, LH(luteinizing hormone) and HbA1c(hemoglobin A1c) levels after the 12-week treatment. GLP-1RA + Met was more effective than CPA/EE + Met in reducing body weight, BMI (Body Mass Index), and waist circumference, FBG(fasting blood glucose), AUCI(area under curve of insulin),TC (Total Cholesterol), IL-6(Interleukin-6) and improving insulin sensitivity, and ovulation in overweight women with PCOS, with acceptable short-term side effects. CPA/EE + Met was more effective in improving hyperandrogenemia, including T(total testosterone), LH, LH/FSH(Luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone), SHBG(sex hormone-binding globulin) and FAI (free androgen index). By contract, GLP-1RA+Met group only improved LH. Plasma proteomic analysis revealed that the interventions altered proteins involved in reactive oxygen species detoxification (PRDX6, GSTO1, GSTP1, GSTM2), platelet degranulation (FN1), and the immune response (SERPINB9). Conclusions: Both CPA/EE+Met and GLP-1RA + Met treatment improved reproductive functions in overweight PCOS women. GLP-1RA + Met was more effective than CPA/EE + Met in reducing body weight, BMI, and waist, and improving metabolism, and ovulation in overweight women with PCOS, with acceptable short-term side effects. CPA/EE + Met was more effective in reducing hyperandrogenemia. The novel plasma biomarkers PRDX6, FN1, and SERPINB9, might be indicators and targets for PCOS treatment.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS STEP 1, 3, and 4 were phase 3, 68-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational trials; STEP 4 had a 20-week semaglutide run-in and 48-week randomized period. Analyses included changes (week 0–68; before the washout period) in glycemic status (prespecified: STEP 1 and 3; post hoc: STEP 4), and in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and HOMA insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) among participants with prediabetes (post hoc). RESULTS Significantly more participants with baseline (week 0) prediabetes (n = 1,536) had nor-moglycemia at week 68 with semaglutide versus placebo (STEP 1, 84.1% vs. 47.8%; STEP 3, 89.5% vs. 55.0%; STEP 4, 89.8% vs. 70.4%; all P < 0.0001). Fewer participants with baseline normoglycemia had prediabetes at week 68 with semaglutide versus placebo (STEP 1, 2.9% vs. 10.9%; STEP 3, 3.2% vs. 5.8%; STEP 4, 1.1% vs. 5.0%). Semaglutide resulted in greater improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and HOMA-IR than placebo among participants with baseline prediabetes (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS STEP 1, 3, and 4 collectively provide a robust assessment of the effects of sema-glutide on glucose metabolism and prediabetes in a large cohort of adults with overweight/obesity while on treatment. Among participants with baseline predi-abetes, 68 weeks’ treatment with semaglutide versus placebo led to significant improvements in glucose metabolism and a higher likelihood of normoglycemia. © 2022 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adult; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Glucagon-Like Peptides; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Obesity; Overweight; Prediabetic State; acarbose; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; metformin; pioglitazone; placebo; rosiglitazone; semaglutide; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide; glycosylated hemoglobin; semaglutide; adult; Article; body weight change; body weight loss; body weight management; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetic patient; drug dose escalation; drug effect; fasting blood glucose level; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glycemic control; HOMA index; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; multicenter study (topic); non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; open study; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); post hoc analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk reduction; therapy effect; treatment duration; double blind procedure; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138853759"

We investigated whether the effect of this agent on cardiometabolic parameters in subjects with T2DM varied in relation to the concomitant presence of obesity. Methods: One hundred thirty-five subjects (78 men and 57 women; age: 62 ± 10 years) naïve to incretin-based therapies were treated with low-dose liraglutide (1.2 mg/day) as an add-on to metformin for 18 months. Patients were divided into two subgroups based on their body-mass index (BMI): (a) obese (BMI ≥ 30) and (b) non-obese (BMI < 30). Clinical and laboratory analyses were assessed at baseline and every 6 months. Results: During follow-up, significant improvements were seen in both groups in fasting glycemia, glycated hemoglobin, waist circumference, and carotid intima–media thickness (cIMT), while body weight, BMI, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly in obese subjects only. Correlation analysis revealed that changes in subclinical atherosclerosis (assessed by cIMT) were associated with changes in triglycerides (r = 0.488, p < 0.0001) in the obese group only. Conclusion: Liraglutide had beneficial actions on glycemic parameters and cardiometabolic risk factors in both non-obese and obese patients with T2DM, with a greater efficacy in the latter. These findings reinforce the benefits of liraglutide for the cardiometabolic outcomes of obese patients with T2DM in the real-world setting. This has critical importance during the current pandemic, since patients with diabetes and obesity are exposed globally to the most severe forms of COVID-19, related complications, and death.

Methods: Adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m2 enrolled in a pilot, 17-week double-blind, randomized controlled trial of liraglutide 3.0 mg/day for BED. The primary outcome was number of objective binge episodes (OBEs)/week. Binge remission, weight change, and psychosocial variables were secondary outcomes. Mixed effect models were used for continuous variables, and generalized estimating equations were used for remission rates. Results: Participants (n = 27) were 44.2 ± 10.6 years; BMI = 37.9 ± 11.8 kg/m2; 63% women; and 59% White and 41% Black.

However, their comparative value for money for this indication is unclear. Methods: The cost needed to treat to achieve a 1% reduction in body weight using semaglutide or liraglutide was calculated. The body weight reductions were extracted from the published STEP 1 trial and the SCALE trial results, respectively. A scenario analysis was performed to mitigate the primary differences between the two studies' populations. Drug costs were based on US GoodRx prices as of October 2022. Results: Liraglutide in STEP 1 resulted in a weight loss of 5.4% (95% CI: 5%-5.8%). Semaglutide in SCALE resulted in a weight loss of 12.4% (95% CI: 11.5%-13.4%). The total cost of therapy with liraglutide during the trial was estimated at $17,585 compared with $22,878 with semaglutide. Accordingly, the cost needed to treat per 1% of body weight reduction with liraglutide is estimated at $3256 (95% CI: $3032-$3517) compared with $1845 (95% CI: $1707-$1989) with semaglutide. Conclusions: Semaglutide provides significantly better value for money than liraglutide for weight reduction. © 2023 The Authors.

Underlying causes and preventive strategies are being investigated. Two glucagon like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, liraglutide and semaglutide, were formerly approved as glucose-lowering drugs and have been recently approved for long-term weight loss in people with obesity. Due to the lack of therapeutic guidelines or clinical trials in people with HIV, we discuss the potential benefits, safety aspects and pharmacological considerations of prescribing liraglutide and semaglutide in people with HIV. Results: Clinical experience is limited to two clinical cases of diabetic people with HIV using liraglutide after which a successful weight loss and glycaemic control were observed. None of the adverse events associated with liraglutide and semaglutide usage indicate an additional risk for people with HIV. Extra caution showed be warranted when initiating GLP-1 agonist therapy in people with HIV taking protease inhibitors who have pre-existing risk factors for heart rate variability to reduce the incidence of RP interval prolongation. GLP-1 agonists are metabolized by endopeptidases, and thus do not generate major drug–drug interactions with most drugs, including ARVs. GLP-s agonists are known to inhibit gastric acid secretion, which warrants caution and close monitoring when combined with atazanavir and oral rilpivirine, two ARVs that require low gastric pH for an optimal absorption. Conclusion: Theoretical considerations and a few available clinical observations support semaglutide and liraglutide prescription in people with HIV, with, thus far, no indications of concern regarding efficacy, safety or pharmacological interactions with ARVs. © 2023 British HIV Association.","GLP-1 agonist; HIV; liraglutide; obesity; semaglutide","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; HIV Infections; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Obesity; Weight Loss; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; body weight loss; complication; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162727750"

Treatment of obesity is necessary as it is associated with fatal complications like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis, and many more. Liraglutide (Lir), a synthetic analogue of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), is the FDA approved anti-obesity drug, however, its major limitation is its clinical application which needs frequent parenteral injections. To address the issue of regular injection, we have synthesized a fat fighting oral nano-formulation of liraglutide with a sustained release feature, which was evaluated against high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in mice. Experimental obesity was induced in mice by feeding HFD for 26 weeks. Lir nanoparticles (NP) were fabricated with chitosan via ion-gelation technique and were coated with Eudragit@S100 to protect the drug in harsh gastric conditions. Physiochemical characterization of Eu-Lir-Cs-NP demonstrated a small particle size of 253.1 ± 1.21 nm with ∼ 9.74 % loading and ∼ 72.11 % encapsulation efficiency of the drug. In-vitro studies showed successful cellular uptake of NP in Caco-2 cells and were stable in various enteric fluid pH conditions. Eudragit@S100 coated chitosan NP were able to protect the drug from harsh gastric pH conditions with more than ∼ 74% of recovery. Treatment of two weeks of liraglutide Eu-Lir-Cs-NP (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, orally; twice daily) moderately reduces obesity in mice as evidenced by a reduction in the body weight, blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, serum triglyceride, serum resistin and serum insulin level of mice. In addition, significant reduction of liver weight, abdominal white adipose tissue, and hepatic oxidative stress were noted. Our results suggest that chitosan-based NP of liraglutide can be an effective and convenient formulation for the management of obesity. © 2023","Chitosan; Eudragit@S100; Glucagon like peptide-1; Liraglutide; Nanoparticle; Obesity","Animals; Caco-2 Cells; Chitosan; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Mice; Polymethacrylic Acids; chitosan nanoparticle; eudragit; liraglutide; nanochain; resistin; antidiabetic agent; chitosan; liraglutide; methylmethacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer; polymethacrylic acid derivative; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight loss; Caco-2 cell line; cholesterol blood level; drug formulation; feeding; gelation; glucose blood level; in vitro study; insulin blood level; lipid diet; liver weight; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; obesity management; oxidative stress; particle size; pH; sustained drug release; triacylglycerol blood level; white adipose tissue; animal; human","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147587938"

Methods: From April 30, 2020, to April 30, 2022, a prospective randomized controlled study was carried out at the Endocrinology Department of Beijing Hospital, the National Center of Gerontology. According to the in- and exclusion criteria and by the random table method, revisited T2DM patients were selected as the research subjects and were allocated into a Study group (taking liraglutide) and a Control group (underwent lifestyle interventions). All patients received continuous 12-weeks interventions to the endpoint, and the changes of value [Δ=(endpoint)-(baseline)] of physical measurements, blood tests, the energy spectrum CT examination results, and body composition analysis results were analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 85 people completed this study, and among them, 47 were in the Study group and 38 were in the Control group.

Having severe obesity markedly compromises health, well-being and quality of life, and substantially reduces life expectancy. These adverse outcomes are prevented or ameliorated by weight loss, for which sustained behavioural change is the cornerstone of treatment. Although NHS specialist ‘Tier 3’ Weight Management Services (T3WMS) support people with severe obesity, using individual and group-based treatment, the current evidence on optimal intervention design and outcomes is limited. Due to heterogeneity of severe obesity, there is a need to tailor treatment to address individual needs. Despite this heterogeneity, there are good reasons to suspect that a structured group-based behavioural intervention may be more effective and cost-effective for the treatment of severe obesity compared to usual care. The aims of this study are to test the feasibility of establishing and delivering a multi-centre randomised controlled clinical trial to compare a group-based behavioural intervention versus usual care in people with severe obesity. Methods: This feasibility randomised controlled study is a partially clustered multi-centre trial of PROGROUP (a novel group-based behavioural intervention) versus usual care. Adults ≥18 years of age who have been newly referred to and accepted by NHS T3WMS will be eligible if they have a BMI ≥40, or ≥35 kg/m2 with comorbidity, are suitable for group-based care and are willing to be randomised. Exclusion criteria are participation in another weight management study, planned bariatric surgery during the trial, and unwillingness or inability to attend group sessions. Outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation and success of blinding will be evaluated. Clinical measures will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. Secondary outcome measures will be self-reported and collected remotely. Process and economic evaluations will be conducted. Discussion: This randomised feasibility study has been designed to test all the required research procedures and additionally explore three key issues; the feasibility of implementing a complex trial at participating NHS T3WMS, training the multidisciplinary healthcare teams in a standard intervention, and the acceptability of a group intervention for these particularly complex patients.

This study was an observational cross-sectional study, with additional short-term intervention studies and follow-up studies. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore the association of PCOS with metabolic-related genes and signaling pathways. OGTT and EHC were performed on all participants. Lipid infusion, cold exposure, and 45-min treadmill test were performed on all healthy women. A total of 137 women with PCOS were treated with metformin, GLP-1RA, or TZDs for 24 weeks. Serum HHIP levels were higher in insulin resistance (IR) and PCOS women. Circulating HHIP levels were significantly correlated with adiponectin (Adipoq) levels, obesity, IR, and metabolic indicators. A correlation presented between HHIP and DHEA-S, FAI, SHBG, and FSH. Serum HHIP levels were significantly elevated by oral glucose challenge in healthy women, but not affected by EHC.

Given evolving treatments for obesity, evaluating its prevalence and treatment practices are key to develop a holistic management of PAD. We aimed to examine prevalence of obesity and variability of management strategies in symptomatic PAD patients enrolled in the international multicenter PORTRAIT registry from 2011 to 2015. Obesity management strategies studied included weight and/or dietary counseling and prescription of weight loss medications (orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-buproprion, and liraglutide). Use frequency of obesity management strategies were calculated by country and compared across centers using adjusted median odds ratios (MOR). Of 1002 patients included, 36 % had obesity. No patients received weight loss medications. Weight and/or dietary counseling was prescribed in only 20 % of patients with obesity with significant variability in practices between centers (range 0.0–39.7 %; MOR 3.6, 95 % CI 2.04–9.95, p = < 0.001). In conclusion, obesity is a prevalent modifiable comorbidity in PAD that is hardly addressed during PAD management, with significant variability across practices. As obesity prevalence rates are growing, along with treatment modalities to treat it, especially in those with PAD, building systems to integrate systematic evidence-based weight and dietary management strategies in PAD are essential to close this gap in care. © 2023 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity","Obesity; Outcomes; Peripheral artery disease; Registry","Anti-Obesity Agents; Humans; Obesity; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Prevalence; Topiramate; Weight Loss; amfebutamone; liraglutide; lorcaserin; naltrexone; phentermine plus topiramate; tetrahydrolipstatin; antiobesity agent; topiramate; aged; Article; body weight management; comorbidity; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; nutritional counseling; obese patient; obesity; obesity management; peripheral arterial disease; prescription; prevalence; body weight loss; clinical trial; complication; multicenter study; obesity; peripheral arterial disease; prevalence","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160078818"

Methods: A total of 88 adults with obesity and prediabetes were randomized to 14 weeks of intervention with CR (−390 kcal/d), liraglutide (1.8 mg/d), or the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin (100 mg/d) as a weight-neutral comparator. Changes between groups in appetite and hunger ratings measured via visual analogue scales, dietary intakes, body weight, body composition via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and resting energy expenditure via indirect calorimetry were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test or Pearson's chi-squared test. Results: Weight loss ≥5% of baseline body weight occurred in 44% of participants in the CR group, 22% of the liraglutide group and 5% of the sitagliptin group (p = 0.02). The ratio of fat to lean mass decreased by 6.5% in the CR group, 2.2% in the liraglutide group, and 0% in the sitagliptin group (p = 0.02). Visceral fat reduced by 9.5% in the CR group, 4.8% in the liraglutide group, and 0% in the sitagliptin group (p = 0.04). A spontaneous reduction in dietary simple carbohydrates in the CR group was associated with improved homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance score (HOMA-IR). Conclusions: Although both liraglutide and CR are valuable strategies for cardiometabolic risk reduction, CR was associated with greater weight loss and more favourable improvements in body composition than treatment with liraglutide alone. Differences in the response to each of these interventions enables patients to be stratified to the most optimal intervention for their personal risk factors. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","caloric restriction; diet; glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist; liraglutide; obesity; prediabetes; weight loss","Adult; Appetite; Body Fat Distribution; Body Weight; Caloric Restriction; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases; Eating; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Obesity; Prediabetic State; Sitagliptin Phosphate; Weight Loss; carbohydrate; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin; liraglutide; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; sitagliptin; adult; aged; appetite; Article; body composition; body fat distribution; body weight; body weight loss; caloric restriction; cardiometabolic risk; controlled study; dietary intake; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat mass; female; glomerulus filtration rate; homeostasis model assessment; human; impaired glucose tolerance; indirect calorimetry; insulin resistance; intra-abdominal fat; Kruskal Wallis test; major clinical study; male; obesity; randomized controlled trial; resting energy expenditure; risk factor; risk reduction; visual analog scale; cardiovascular disease; complication; eating; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159168348"

In this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, adults with obesity were randomized, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio stratified by sex and age group (<40 years and ≥40 years), to one-year weight loss maintenance with exercise, the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, or the combination, as compared with placebo, after low-calorie diet-induced weight loss. Primary outcome was change in body weight, which has been published. Here, we investigated the effects of weight loss maintenance with exercise, liraglutide, or the combination on weight loss-induced changes in the pre-specified explorative outcomes, eating and sedentary behavior in 130 participants who completed the trial according to the study protocol (exercise (n = 26), liraglutide (n = 36), combination (n = 29), and placebo (n = 39)). One year after weight loss, the placebo group had decreased postprandial appetite suppression score by 14%, and increased sedentary time by 31 min/day and regained weight. Liraglutide prevented the decrease in postprandial appetite suppression score compared with placebo (0% vs. −14%; P = 0.023) and maintained weight loss. Exercise after weight loss did not increase appetite or sedentary behavior compared with placebo, despite increased exercise energy expenditure and maintained weight loss. The combination of exercise and liraglutide increased cognitive restraint score (13% vs. −9%; P = 0.042), reflecting a conscious restriction of food intake, and decreased sedentary time by 41 min/day (−10 vs. 31 min/day; 95%CI, −82.3 to −0.2; P = 0.049) compared with placebo, which may have facilitated the additional weight loss. Targeting both eating and sedentary behavior could be the most effective for preventing weight regain.

Since weight regain after weight loss remains a major obstacle in obesity treatment, we investigated whether insufficient sleep predicts weight regain during weight loss maintenance. Methods: In a randomized, controlled, two-by-two factorial study, 195 adults with obesity completed an 8-week low-calorie diet and were randomly assigned to 1-year weight loss maintenance with or without exercise and liraglutide 3.0 mg/day or placebo. Sleep duration and quality were measured before and after the low-calorie diet and during weight maintenance using wrist-worn accelerometers (GENEActiv) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). To test associations between insufficient sleep and weight regain, participants were stratified at randomization into subgroups according to sleep duration (</≥6 h/night) or sleep quality (PSQI score ≤/>5). Results: After a diet-induced 13.1 kg weight loss, participants with short sleep duration at randomization regained 5.3 kg body weight (p = .0008) and had less reduction in body fat percentage compared with participants with normal sleep duration (p = .007) during the 1-year weight maintenance phase. Participants with poor sleep quality before the weight loss regained 3.5 kg body weight compared with good quality sleepers (p = .010). During the weight maintenance phase, participants undergoing liraglutide treatment displayed increased sleep duration compared with placebo after 26 weeks (5 vs. −15 min/night) but not after 1 year. Participants undergoing exercise treatment preserved the sleep quality improvements attained from the initial weight loss. Conclusions: Short sleep duration or poor sleep quality was associated with weight regain after weight loss in adults with obesity. © Sleep Research Society 2022.","exercise; GLP-1 receptor agonist; obesity; sleep duration; sleep quality; weight loss maintenance","leptin receptor; liraglutide; placebo; adult; aged; Article; body composition; body fat percentage; body weight; body weight loss; controlled study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; human; kinesiotherapy; low calorie diet; major clinical study; male; obesity; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; practice guideline; randomized controlled trial; sedentary time; sleep disorder; sleep efficiency; sleep latency; sleep quality; sleep time","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163137575"

Materials and Methods: Individuals with obesity and prediabetes were randomized to 14 weeks of the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide, hypocaloric diet or the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin in a 2:1:1 ratio. Treatment with drug was double blind and placebo-controlled. Measurements were made at baseline, after 2 weeks prior to significant weight loss and after 14 weeks. The primary outcomes were measures of endothelial function: flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Results: Eighty-eight individuals were studied (liraglutide N = 44, diet N = 22, sitagliptin N = 22). Liraglutide and diet reduced weight, insulin resistance and PAI-1, while sitagliptin did not. There was no significant effect of any treatment on endothelial vasodilator function measured by FMD. Post hoc subgroup analyses in individuals with baseline FMD below the median, indicative of greater endothelial dysfunction, showed an improvement in FMD by all three treatments. GLP-1R antagonism with exendin (9-39) increased fasting blood glucose but did not change FMD or PAI-1. There was no effect of treatment on UACR. Finally, liraglutide, but not sitagliptin or diet, reduced the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Conclusion: Liraglutide and diet reduce weight, insulin resistance and PAI-1. Liraglutide, sitagliptin and diet do not change FMD in obese individuals with prediabetes with normal endothelial function. Liraglutide alone lowers the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherosclerotic chemokine MCP-1, indicating that this beneficial effect is independent of weight loss. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","cardiovascular disease; dietary intervention; DPP4 inhibitor; GLP-1 receptor agonist; incretin physiology; randomized trial","Diet, Reducing; Fibrinolysis; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Inflammation; Insulin Resistance; Liraglutide; Obesity; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Prediabetic State; Sitagliptin Phosphate; Weight Loss; albumin; antihypertensive agent; avexitide; creatinine; liraglutide; monocyte chemotactic protein 2; placebo; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; incretin; liraglutide; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; sitagliptin; adult; albumin to creatinine ratio; Article; body weight loss; case control study; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; drug dose escalation; drug effect; female; fibrinolysis; human; impaired glucose tolerance; inflammation; insulin resistance; low calorie diet; major clinical study; male; middle aged; obesity; post hoc analysis; randomization; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; vascular endothelium; vasodilatation; body weight loss; complication; fibrinolysis; inflammation; insulin resistance; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141976435"

It is reported that even a modest weight loss of 5–10% substantially may improve the reproductive and metabolic profile. This study aims to assess the efficacy of the low dose of liraglutide (0.6 mg QD) combined with metformin (0.85 mg BID) in weight loss in Chinese Han women with PCOS. Methods: We included clinical data of 102 obese/overweight (≥18 years, body mass index ≥28 kg/m2 or ≥24 kg/m2) women who were diagnosed with PCOS from October 2016 to March 2018 in Wuhan Union Hospital initially. They were treated with dinae-35, low dose of liraglutide (0.6 mg QD) and metformin (0.85 mg BID) for 12 weeks. The demographic and clinical data were retrieved retrospectively, and weight loss was the main outcome measure. Student’s paired t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare the differences before and after therapy, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Participants(n = 102)had lost a mean of 7.20 ± 3.42 kg of body weight (95%CI: 6.55–7.86, p < 0.001), and the mean reduction of BMI was 2.87 ± 1.36 kg/m2 (95%CI: 0.02–0.27, p < 0.001). A total of 88.24% of participants lost more than 5% of their body weight. Conclusion: The combination of low dose of liraglutide and metformin was associated with significant reduction of body weight in Chinese Han women with PCOS. Additionally, a larger randomized double-blind multicenter controlled clinical trial is needed to confirm that.

Endoscopic interventions have been developed as potential alternatives to those not eligible or fearful of the risks of metabolic surgery.Methods:In this multicenter open-label RCT, 170 adults with inadequately controlled T2DM and obesity were randomized to intensive medical care with or without the DJBL. Primary outcome was the percentage of participants achieving a glycated hemoglobin reduction of ≥20% at 12months. Secondary outcomes included weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors at 12 and 24months.Results:There were no significant differences in the percentage of patients achieving the primary outcome between both groups at 12months [DJBL 54.6% (n = 30) vs control 55.2% (n = 32); odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-2.0; P = 0.85]. Twenty-four percent (n = 16) patients achieved ≥15% weight loss in the DJBL group compared to 4% (n = 2) in the controls at 12months (OR 8.3, 95% CI: 1.8-39; P=.007). The DJBL group experienced superior reductions in systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and alanine transaminase at 12 months. There were more adverse events in the DJBL group.Conclusions:The addition of the DJBL to intensive medical care was associated with superior weight loss, improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, and fatty liver disease markers, but not glycemia, only while the device was in situ. The benefits of the devices need to be balanced against the higher rate of adverse events when making clinical decisions.Trial Registration:ISRCTN30845205. isrctn.org; Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme, a Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) partnership reference 12/10/04. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Proper herbal medicine based on PI has been suggested for effective weight reduction and decreasing the adverse events. This systematic review examined the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine, focusing on PI in treating obesity. Methods: Eight electric databases were used for searching randomized controlled trials (RCT) (to August 31, 2021). RCTs which prescribed herbal medicine to obese patients based on PI were included. Body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) were the primary outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the meta-analysis was conducted. Grading the evidence was conducted by using GRADEpro. Results: Sixteen RCTs (1052 patients) were included: 2 studies compared herbal medicine to placebo (128 patients); 2 studies compared them to western medication (161 patients); 12 studies compared them with usual care (763 patients). The meta-analysis showed that the herbal formulas reduced the BW and BMI without significant Adverse events compared to the control group (BW: mean difference  = -4.10, 95% confidence interval: -5.14 to -3.06, I2 = 2% and BMI: mean difference = -1.53, 95% confidence interval: -1.88 to -1.19, I2 = 25%). Moderate-quality evidence on the primary outcomes was found. Conclusions: Herbal medicine - has good clinical efficacy and safety in treating obesity. This study has limitations that some literatures with high risk of bias in blinding or without using a standardized diagnosis of PI were included. However, the current evidence suggests the possibility of precision medicine using PI. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is a complex disease with no approved pharmacotherapies, arising from an underlying state of systemic metabolic dysfunction in association with T2DM and obesity. Cotadutide has been shown to improve glycaemic control, body weight, lipids, liver fat, inflammation and fibrosis. We conducted a two-part, randomized phase 2a trial in men and women with overweight or obesity diagnosed with T2DM to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cotadutide compared with placebo and liraglutide. The primary endpoints were change from baseline to day 28 of treatment in postprandial hepatic glycogen (part A) and to day 35 of treatment in fasting hepatic glycogen (part B) with cotadutide versus placebo. Secondary endpoints in part B were changes in fasting hepatic glycogen with cotadutide versus the mono glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, and change in hepatic fat fraction. The trial met its primary endpoint. We showed that cotadutide promotes greater reductions in liver glycogen and fat compared with placebo and liraglutide. Safety and tolerability findings with cotadutide were comparable to those of previous reports. Thus, this work provides evidence of additional benefits of cotadutide that could be attributed to glucagon receptor engagement.

There are many treatment options available to patients. We provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence on the treatment effects of several potential interventions for NAFLD with T2DM. Methods: This systematic review and network meta-analysis included searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to June 30, 2023, for randomised controlled trials of treatment of NAFLD with T2DM. We performed Bayesian network meta-analyses to summarise effect estimates of comparisons between interventions. We applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) frameworks to rate all comparative outcomes’ certainty in effect estimates, categorise interventions, and present the findings. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022342373. Results: Four thousand three hundred and sixty-nine records were retrieved from the database and other methods, of which 24 records were eligible for studies enrolling 1589 participants. Eight clinical indicators and 14 interventions were finally in focus. Referring to the lower surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) and the league matrix table, exenatide and liraglutide, which are also glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), showed excellent potential to reduce liver fat content, control glycemia, reduce body weight, and improve liver function and insulin resistance. Exenatide was more effective in reducing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (mean difference (MD) 0.32, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.52), lowering BMI (MD 0.81, 95%CI 0.18 to 1.45), and lowering alanine transaminase (ALT) (MD 10.96, 95%CI 5.27 to 16.66) compared to liraglutide. However, this evidence was assessed as low certainty. Omega-3 was the only intervention that did not have a tendency to lower HbA1c, with standard-treatment (STA-TRE) as reference (MD − 0.17, 95%CI − 0.42 to 0.07). Glimepiride is the only intervention that causes an increase in ALT levels, with standard-treatment (STA-TRE) as reference (MD − 11.72, 95%CI − 17.82 to − 5.57). Based on the available evidence, the treatment effects of pioglitazone, dapagliflozin, and liraglutide have a high degree of confidence. Conclusions: The high confidence mandates the confident application of these findings as guides for clinical practice. Dapagliflozin and pioglitazone are used for glycaemic control in patients with NAFLD combined with T2DM, and liraglutide is used for weight loss therapy in patients with abdominal obesity. The available evidence does not demonstrate the credibility of the effectiveness of other interventions in reducing liver fat content, visceral fat area, ALT, and insulin resistance. Future studies should focus on the clinical application of GLP-1Ras and the long-term prognosis of patients. © 2023, The Author(s).","Bayesian network meta-analysis; Diabetes mellitus, type 2; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; Systematic review; Weight loss","Bayes Theorem; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Exenatide; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Liraglutide; Network Meta-Analysis; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Pioglitazone; alanine aminotransferase; dapagliflozin; exendin 4; gliclazide; glimepiride; hemoglobin A1c; ipragliflozin; liraglutide; metformin; omega 3 fatty acid; pioglitazone; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; dapagliflozin; exendin 4; liraglutide; abdominal obesity; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; Bayesian network; body mass; body weight loss; clinical practice; comparative effectiveness; diet therapy; evidence based medicine; exercise; follow up; glycemic control; human; insulin resistance; lifestyle modification; liver function; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; practice guideline; systematic review; treatment outcome; treatment response; waist circumference; Bayes theorem; insulin resistance; network meta-analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177445555"

In the LEADER trial, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, liraglutide, resulted in lower rates of the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease than placebo. Therefore, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend the decision to treat high-risk individuals with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor to reduce chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression should be considered. A 72-year-old male obese diabetic patient developed CKD stage G4 despite of use of both SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 receptor agonist. We started using sodium bicarbonate because he showed metabolic acidosis due to uremia. We also started to use spherical carbonaceous adsorbent which adsorbs indole, the precursor of indoxyl sulfate, uremic toxin. We started the treatment with finerenone, a nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which has been recently shown to lower risks of CKD progression. Considering unfavorable effects of hyperuricemia on CKD, to treat his hyperuricemia, we started to use dotinurad, a novel selective urate reabsorption inhibitor, which reduces serum urate levels by selective inhibition of urate transporter 1.

A literature search using select keywords in separate was performed in PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for phase III/IV clinical trials during the last ten years. Our findings indicate that the quality of existing clinical evidence from anti-obesity trials generally ranges from low to moderate. Most trials suffered from publication bias. Less frequently, trials suffered from the risk of bias mainly due to lack of blindness in the treatment.

Several studies have been published evaluating the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) for weight loss post-bariatric surgery. However, no systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) till date has evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GLP1RA in this clinical scenario. Hence, this SRM aimed to address this knowledge gap. Methods: Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case–control, cohort and observational studies involving use of GLP1RA in the intervention arm post-bariatric surgery. Primary outcome was weight loss post at least 3 months of therapy. Secondary outcomes were evaluation of body composition parameters, total adverse events (TAEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs). Results: From initially screened 1759 articles, 8 studies (557 individuals) were analysed. Compared to placebo, patients receiving liraglutide had significantly greater weight loss after 6-month therapy [MD − 6.0 kg (95% CI, − 8.66 to − 3.33); P < 0.001; I2 = 79%]. Compared to liraglutide, semaglutide had significantly greater percent reduction in body weight after 6-month [MD − 2.57% (95% CI, − 3.91 to − 1.23); P < 0.001; I2 = 0%] and 12-month [MD − 4.15% (95% CI, − 6.96 to − 1.34); P = 0.004] therapy. In study by Murvelashvili et al. (2023), after 12-month therapy, semaglutide had significantly higher rates of achieving > 15% [OR 2.15 (95% CI, 1.07–4.33); P = 0.03; n = 207] and > 10% [OR 2.10 (95% CI, 1.19–3.71); P = 0.01; n = 207] weight loss. A significant decrease in fat mass [MD − 4.78 kg (95% CI, − 7.11 to − 2.45); P < 0.001], lean mass [MD − 3.01 kg (95% CI, − 4.80 to − 1.22); P = 0.001] and whole-body bone mineral density [MD − 0.02 kg/m2 (95% CI, − 0.04 to − 0.00); P = 0.03] was noted with liraglutide. Conclusion: Current data is encouraging regarding use of GLP1RAs for managing WG or IWL post-bariatric surgery. Deterioration of bone health and muscle mass remains a concern needing further evaluation.

Combining action profiles of multiple gastrointestinal hormones within a single molecule, these novel therapeutics achieve synergistic metabolic benefits. The first such compound, reported in 2009, was based on balanced co-agonism at glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors. Today, several classes of gut hormone co-agonists are in development and advancing through clinical trials, including dual GLP-1–glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) co-agonists (first described in 2013), and triple GIP–GLP-1–glucagon co-agonists (initially designed in 2015). The GLP-1–GIP co-agonist tirzepatide was approved in 2022 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, providing superior HbA1c reductions compared to basal insulin or selective GLP-1 receptor agonists. Tirzepatide also achieved unprecedented weight loss of up to 22.5%—similar to results achieved with some types of bariatric surgery—in non-diabetic individuals with obesity. In this Perspective, we summarize the discovery, development, mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy of the different types of gut hormone co-agonists, and discuss potential challenges, limitations and future developments. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gastrointestinal Hormones; Glucagon; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Obesity; United States; creatinine; dulaglutide; empagliflozin; evolocumab; exendin 4; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; gastrointestinal hormone; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucagon like peptide 2; gonadotropin; hemoglobin A1c; incretin; insulin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; new drug; oxyntomodulin; pioglitazone; proglucagon; saxagliptin; semaglutide; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; tirzepatide; triacylglycerol; glucagon like peptide 1; adipose tissue; apoptosis; Article; bariatric surgery; body mass; body weight loss; caloric intake; cardiometabolic risk; cell proliferation; constipation; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; drug safety; dyspepsia; energy expenditure; fat mass; Food and Drug Administration; food intake; gastric bypass surgery; glomerulus filtration rate; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; glycogenolysis; human; hyperglucagonemia; hyperglycemia; hypertriglyceridemia; hypoglycemia; irritable colon; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; lipolysis; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; ovary polycystic disease; oxygen consumption; physical activity; prevalence; risk factor; stomach emptying; vomiting; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162586370"

The mean differences, ORs, 95% credible intervals (95% CI), the surface under the cumulative ranking were evaluated for each outcome by network meta-analysis. Results Sixty-one RCTs were included in our analysis. Both GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is conferred greater extents in body weight reduction, achieving at least 5% wt loss, HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose decrease compared with placebo. GLP-1RAs was superior to SGLT-2is in HbA1c reduction (MD: -0.39%, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.08). GLP-1RAs had high risk of adverse events, while SGLT-2is were relatively safe. Based on intraclass comparison, semaglutide 2.4 mg was among the most effective interventions in losing body weight (MD: -11.51 kg, 95% CI -12.83 to -10.21), decreasing HbA1c (MD: -1.49%, 95% CI -2.07 to -0.92) and fasting plasma glucose (MD: -2.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -2.83 to -1.59), reducing systolic blood pressure (MD: -4.89 mm Hg, 95% CI -6.04 to -3.71) and diastolic blood pressure (MD: -1.59 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.37 to -0.86) with moderate certainty evidences, while it was associated with high risk of adverse events. Conclusions Semaglutide 2.4 mg showed the greatest effects on losing body weight, controlling glycaemic level and reducing blood pressure while it was associated with high risk of adverse events. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Methods: This was a multicenter, non-randomized, retrospective study involving 4 academic hospitals. Patients underwent IGB placement with or without concomitant anti-obesity pharmacotherapy. The primary outcome was percent total weight loss (TBWL) after IGB placement at 6 and 12 months. Results: This study included 102 patients, with 23 patients (mean age 46.6 years, 82.6% female) treated with IGB/pharmacotherapy and 79 patients (mean age 46.0 years, 88.6% female) treated with IGB/lifestyle modifications. Patients had a 100% follow-up rate at 6 and 12 months. At 6 months following IGB placement, both groups achieved a similar %TBWL. At 12 months, %TBWL was greater in the IGB/pharmacotherapy group (12.6% ± 1.2 vs 9.7% ± 0.7, P =.04). 65.2% of patients achieved ≥10% TBWL at 12 months in the IGB/pharmacotherapy group, compared to 38.0% in the IGB/lifestyle group (P <.05). The proportion of patients that achieved ≥15% weight loss at 12 months was also significantly different between the IGB/pharmacotherapy and IGB/lifestyle groups (30.4% vs 20.3%, P <.05). Discussion: IGB with concomitant use of pharmacotherapy did not improve weight loss while the IGB was in place compared to IGB and lifestyle changes. However, patients receiving IGB with pharmacotherapy did have greater weight loss and diminished weight regain after balloon removal compared to those receiving just IGB and lifestyle changes. © The Author(s) 2021.","endobariatrics; obesity; pharmacotherapy; weight regain","Female; Gastric Balloon; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Obesity, Morbid; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; amfebutamone; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; antiobesity agent; liraglutide; metformin; phentermine; phentermine plus topiramate; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; adjuvant therapy; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; body mass; body weight gain; body weight loss; Caucasian; cohort analysis; device removal; female; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; postoperative period; retrospective study; treatment outcome; clinical trial; complication; gastric balloon; morbid obesity; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118289996"

Aims: The primary aim was to investigate changes of circulating intact GDF-15 (wildtype, non-carrier of the rs1058587 polymorphism coding for the H2O2D mutation) and total GDF-15 (measured irrespective of the mutation) in response to liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and lorcaserin (5-HT2C receptor agonist), two pharmacologic agents that induce food intake and weight reduction. In addition, we perform exploratory correlations of total and intact GDF-15 with clinical, hormonal and metabolo-lipidomic parameters in humans with obesity. Materials and methods: We utilized two studies: 1) Study 1, a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over trial of liraglutide and placebo administration for 5 weeks in subjects with obesity (n = 20; BMI = 35.6 ± 5.9 kg/m2), in escalating doses starting at 0.6 mg/day on week 1 and increased every week, up to the highest dose of 3.0 mg/day during week 5. b) Study 2, a randomized, double-blinded trial of lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily, or placebo for 12-weeks in humans with obesity (n = 34 BMI = 37.4 ± 6.1 kg/m2). Total and intact GDF-15 levels were measured with novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and the metabolomics and lipidomics analysis was performed with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: Total and intact GDF-15 were positively correlated with diabetes risk index and trimethylamine N-oxide and negatively with eGFR. Despite significant changes in body weight, total and intact GDF-15 were not altered in response to liraglutide or lorcaserin treatment in subjects with obesity. Conclusions: Total and intact GDF-15 levels are not altered in response to liraglutide or lorcaserin therapy and are thus not directly involved in the metabolic feedback loop pathways downstream of GLP1 or 5-HT2C receptor agonists. Since neither total nor intact GDF-15 levels were altered in response to weight loss, future studies are needed to elucidate the pathways activated by GDF-15 in humans and its role, if any, in body weight regulation and energy homeostasis. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","GDF15; GFRAL; GLP1; GLP1RA; lipidomics; Liraglutide; Lorcaserin; metabolism; metabolomics; obesity; TGFB","Benzazepines; Body Weight; Double-Blind Method; Growth Differentiation Factor 15; Humans; Liraglutide; Obesity; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C; Weight Loss; biological marker; creatinine; growth differentiation factor 15; liraglutide; lorcaserin; triacylglycerol; trimethylamine oxide; benzazepine derivative; growth differentiation factor 15; liraglutide; lorcaserin; serotonin 2C receptor; adult; anthropometry; Article; blood sampling; body composition; body mass; body weight control; body weight loss; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; creatinine blood level; crossover procedure; diabetes risk score; DNA polymorphism; double blind procedure; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; energy balance; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exercise; fat mass; female; gene frequency; human; kidney function; lean body weight; lipid fingerprinting; lipidomics; major clinical study; male; metabolomics; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; obesity; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity and specificity; body weight; body weight loss; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132337575"

Access to these medications is needed to supplement lifestyle and surgical interventions for millions living with obesity worldwide, but high prices are limiting. This study aimed to review current treatment costs and calculate potential estimated minimum prices (EMPs). Methods: The authors searched national drug price databases across various countries for orlistat, naltrexone-bupropion, topiramate-phentermine, liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. EMPs for antiobesity medications were calculated using established methodology, using active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from the Panjiva database. EMPs were calculated per 30-day course and include costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, formulation, taxation, and 10% profit margin. Results: National prices of antiobesity medications were significantly higher than calculated EMPs. Semaglutide 30-day course prices ranged from $804 (United States) to $95 (Turkey) while the EMP was $40. Liraglutide prices ranged from $1418 (United States) to $252 (Norway) while the EMP was $50. Some oral treatments could be generically manufactured at very low costs per course ($7 for orlistat; $5 for phentermine/topiramate combination tablets), while naltrexone/bupropion was more expensive ($54). Conclusions: This study shows that certain weight loss treatments can be manufactured and sold profitably at low costs, but prices currently range widely between countries, limiting access for those in need. © 2023 The Authors.

Methods: Four databases were searched up to 6 May 2022 for randomized clinical trials assessing the effect of liraglutide on visceral and ectopic fat. The mean and standard deviation of the values of visceral fat, ectopic fat and body mass index were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the type of disease (T2DM or non-T2DM), duration of intervention, dosage of liraglutide and whether life interventions were added to liraglutide therapy. We extracted and integrated the safety assessments reported in each article. Results: Sixteen randomized clinical trials with, in total, 845 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Liraglutide could significantly decrease visceral fat [standard mean difference (SMD) = −0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI; −1.12, −0.33)], liver fat [SMD = −0.78, 95% CI (−1.24, −0.32)] and body mass index [weighted mean difference = −1.44, 95% CI (−1.95, −0.92)] in adult patients with or without T2DM when compared with the control group. However, reduction of epicardial fat by liraglutide [SMD = −0.74, 95% CI (−1.82, 0.34)] was not statistically significant. Subgroup analysis revealed that an adequate dosage (≥1.8 mg/day) and appropriate duration of treatment (ranging from 16 to 40 weeks) were the decisive factors for liraglutide to reduce visceral fat effectively. Mild gastrointestinal reactions were the main adverse event of liraglutide. Conclusions: Liraglutide significantly and safely reduces visceral and ectopic liver fat irrespective of T2DM status, and reduces visceral fat provided adequate dosage and duration of therapy are ensured. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ectopic fat; liraglutide; meta-analysis; type 2 diabetes; visceral fat","insulin glargine; insulin glargine plus metformin; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; unclassified drug; add on therapy; Article; body fat; body mass; confidence interval; data base; diabetes mellitus; drug dose; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug safety; ectopic fat; gastrointestinal symptom; human; intra-abdominal fat; lifestyle modification; liver; meta analysis; obesity; randomized controlled trial (topic); recommended drug dose; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; statistical analysis; systematic review; treatment duration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142395499"

Inactivity, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and smoking are among the classic risk factors for cardiovascular disease. From a pathophysiological point of view, the arteries of our body bear the harmful stimuli produced by these factors and respond to them with a series of intricate adaptive mechanisms. Vascular remodeling constitutes an adaptive response to hemodynamic and inflammatory alterations associated with hypertension, diabetes, and other illnesses. Thickening of the arterial walls leads to endothelial dysfunction and increases the risk of cerebrovascu-lar and coronary events. During the last decades, antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive therapies have been the cornerstone of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Howev-er, it is still unknown whether their efficacy is strictly associated with the control of the classical risk factors or their additive effects on vascular inflammation. Since inflammation of arterial walls is related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, it has been hypothesized that anti-inflammatory therapies could prevent and treat vascular remodeling. Clinical trials based on canakinumab or hydroxychloroquine provide further insight into the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we have analyzed evidence and suggested that inflammation may play an important role in the final pathway of many cardiovascular risk factors. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","C-reactive protein; Cardiovascular diseases; diabetes; endothelial dysfunction; hypertension; inflammation; obesity","Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antihypertensive Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Hypertension; Inflammation; Lipids; Risk Factors; Vascular Remodeling; adiponectin; antihypertensive agent; atorvastatin; C reactive protein; canagliflozin; canakinumab; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; empagliflozin; exendin 4; flavonoid; galectin 3; gamma interferon; glucagon like peptide 1; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; incretin; inflammasome; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; linagliptin; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; matrix metalloproteinase; metformin; mevinolin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monounsaturated fatty acid; nitric oxide; pathogen associated molecular pattern; pioglitazone; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; proprotein convertase 9; protein kinase B; reactive oxygen metabolite; rosuvastatin; serum amyloid A; sitagliptin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; transforming growth factor beta; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; very low density lipoprotein; vildagliptin; antihypertensive agent; antiinflammatory agent; hydroxychloroquine; lipid; acute coronary syndrome; angiogenesis; antihypertensive therapy; antiinflammatory activity; aortic aneurysm; arterial stiffness; artery wall; Article; artificially sweetened beverage; atherogenesis; atheroma; atherosclerosis; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk factor; cell plasticity; coronary angiography; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery disease; Crohn disease; cytokine production; cytokine release; diabetes mellitus; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic obesity; diabetic retinopathy; diastolic blood pressure; dyslipidemia; endoplasmic reticulum stress; endothelial dysfunction; endotoxemia; gene expression; genetic transcription; glycemic control; heart disease; heart failure; heart infarction; heart ventricle remodeling; hemodynamics; hospitalization; human; hypercholesterolemia; hyperglycemia; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; immune response; immunomodulation; inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; innate immunity; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; intestine flora; intestine function; intravascular ultrasound; lifestyle modification; lipid diet; lipid oxidation; lipid storage; lipolysis; lipotoxicity; macrophage; metabolic syndrome X; mouse; myofibroblast; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); prevalence; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; restenosis; retina blood vessel; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; shear stress; signal transduction; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; systolic blood pressure; thrombocyte; upregulation; vascular fibrosis; vascular remodeling; vascular smooth muscle cell; vasculitis; waist circumference; cardiovascular disease; complication; hypertension; inflammation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139374278"

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a practical and effective way of evaluating body composition, especially abdominal fat. Liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog, reduces body weight and improves cardiometabolic parameters. In this prospective non-randomized intervention study, we evaluated the effect of 6 months of treatment with liraglutide (n = 57) on the clinical, laboratory and BIA findings of adult sex-stratified patients diagnosed with obesity and MetS, compared to a control group receiving sibutramine (n = 46). The groups were statistically similar with regard to the age of females (p = 0.852) and males (p = 0.657). Almost all anthropometric and BIA variables were higher in the treatment group than in the comparative group (p < 0.05). Abdominal circumference (AC) decreased significantly more in the treatment group. In males, body weight and fat mass also decreased (p < 0.05). Liraglutide treatment was associated with a greater reduction in trunk fat mass (FMT) (p < 0.05). AC and FMT were strongly correlated (rho = 0.531, p < 0.001) in the treatment group. In the multiple regression analysis, liraglutide treatment remained independently associated with FMT. Treatment with liraglutide for 6 months promoted weight loss, improved cardiometabolic and inflammatory parameters and led to a significant reduction in FMT correlated with AC in obese MetS patients of both sexes. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Adult; Body Weight; Cardiovascular Diseases; Electric Impedance; Female; Humans; Liraglutide; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Obesity; Prospective Studies; liraglutide; adult; body weight; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial; complication; female; human; impedance; male; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; obesity; prospective study","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168222893"

Guidelines suggest medications for obesity management if lifestyle interventions do not lead to substantial weight loss. Randomized control trials have shown the efficacy of anti-obesity medications in inducing weight loss, but real-world data are lacking. Therefore, our study aims to evaluate anti-obesity medications’ effectiveness in reducing weight and improving cardiometabolic parameters and to assess their persistence in a real-world setting. Methods: A historical cohort study using routinely collected data from Clalit Health Services (CHS). We retrieved data on all CHS members aged ≥20 years who initiated anti-obesity medication (orlistat, liraglutide 3 mg, and lorcaserin) between 2018 and 2020. We assessed average weight loss and the percentage of patients that had lost ≥5% and ≥10% of their body weight at 3, 6, and 9 months and compared the effectiveness of these 3 medications. Results: We included 5, 306 CHS members in our study; most (77.8%) were female, aged 40–59 years (52.4%). Treatment with liraglutide 3 mg and lorcaserin was associated with subsequent weight reduction. The average weight loss at 6 months was 5.6 kg (4.95–6.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]) with liraglutide 3 mg and 1.7 kg (1.2–2.2, 95% CI) with lorcaserin. There was no evidence that treatment with orlistat was associated with subsequent weight loss (-0.18 kg [-0.8 to 0.4, 95% CI]). At 6 months, 38% of the patients with orlistat, 43% with lorcaserin, and 51% with liraglutide 3 mg persisted with their treatments (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Liraglutide 3 mg was the primary medication associated with clinically significant weight loss and had the highest persistence rate in our real-world study. © The Author(s) 2022.

METHODS: We analyzed data from COMBINE AF (A Collaboration Between Multiple Institutions to Better Investigate Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulant Use in Atrial Fibrillation), which pooled patient-level data from the 4 pivotal randomized trials of NOAC versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were stroke or systemic embolic events (stroke/SEE) and major bleeding, respectively; secondary outcomes were ischemic stroke/SEE, intracranial hemorrhage, death, and the net clinical outcome (stroke/SEE, major bleeding, or death). Each outcome was examined across BMI and BW. Because few patients had a BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (n=598), the primary analyses were restricted to those with a BMI ≥18.5 kg/m2. RESULTS: Among 58 464 patients, the median BMI was 28.3 (interquartile range, 25.2-32.2) kg/m2, and the median BW was 81.0 (interquartile range, 70.0-94.3) kg. The event probability of stroke/SEE was lower at a higher BMI irrespective of treatment, whereas the probability of major bleeding was lower at a higher BMI with warfarin but relatively unchanged across BMI with NOACs. NOACs reduced stroke/SEE overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.88]; P<0.001), with a generally consistent effect across BMI (Ptrend across HRs, 0.48). NOACs also reduced major bleeding overall (HRadj, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82-0.94]; P<0.001), but with attenuation of the benefit at a higher BMI (trend test across BMI [Ptrend], 0.003). The overall treatment effects of NOACs versus warfarin for secondary outcomes were consistent across BMI, with the exception of the net clinical outcome and death. While these outcomes were overall reduced with NOACs (net clinical outcome, HRadj, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.95]; P<0.001; death, HRadj, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.86-0.97]; P=0.003), these benefits were attenuated at higher BMI (Ptrend, 0.001 and 0.08, respectively). All findings were qualitatively similar when analyzed across BW. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment effect of NOACs versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation is generally consistent for stroke/SEE across the spectrum of BMI and BW, whereas the reduction in major bleeding is attenuated in those with higher BMI or BW. Death and the net clinical outcome are overall reduced with NOACs over warfarin, although there remain uncertainties for these outcomes at a very high BMI and BW. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: One hundred and thirty-six obese adults (87% female) were randomized in a placebo-controlled, 16-week trial of liraglutide, escalated to 3 mg administered SQ daily. Gastrointestinal functions were measured at baseline and 16 weeks: gastric emptying of solids (GET1/2); fasting and postprandial gastric volumes; kcal ingested during ad libitum buffet meal and the nutrient drink test. GET1/2 was also measured at 5 weeks. A multiple variable regression model examined variables associated with weight loss of more than 4 kg at 16 weeks. A parsimonious model using backward selection identified the final model. Results: Weight loss of more than 4 kg at 16 weeks occurred in 71% of liraglutide- and 16% of placebo-treated patients. In all participants combined, parameters univariately associated with a weight loss of more than 4 kg were GET1/2 at 5 and 16 weeks, weight loss at 5 weeks and kcal intake during the buffet meal at 16 weeks. The final parsimonious model (area under the receiver operator characteristics [AUROC] curve = 0.832) identified that factors associated with more than 4-kg weight loss were GET1/2 at 5 weeks (OR = 2.505; 95% CI: 1.57-3.997) per 50 minutes and kcal intake during ad libitum meal at 16 weeks (OR = 0.721; 95% CI: 0.602-0.864) per 100 kcal. Among only the 60 liraglutide-treated subjects, kcal intake at 16 weeks was associated with 4-kg weight loss (AUROC = 0.757). Conclusions: Slower GET1/2 and weight loss at 5 weeks predicted a weight loss of more than 4 kg at 16 weeks in all participants.

Medical management of obesity has proven efficacy for up to 3 years in randomized controlled trials. However, there is a dearth of information regarding real-world outcomes beyond 3 years. Objective: This work aimed to assess long-term weight loss outcomes over a 2.5- to 5.5-year period with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and off-label antiobesity medications (AOMs). Methods: A cohort of 428 patients with overweight or obesity were treated with AOMs at an academic weight management center with an initial visit between April 1, 2014, and April 1, 2016. Intervention included FDA-approved and off-label AOMs. The primary outcome was percentage weight loss from initial to final visit. Key secondary outcomes included weight reduction targets as well as demographic and clinical predictors of long-term weight loss. Results: The average weight loss was 10.4% at a mean follow-up duration of 4.4 years. The proportions of patients who met the weight reduction targets of 5% or greater, 10% or greater, 15% or greater, and 20% or greater were 70.8%, 48.1%, 29.9%, and 17.1%, respectively. On average, 51% of maximum weight loss was regained, while 40.2% of patients maintained their weight loss. In a multivariable regression analysis, a higher number of clinic visits was associated with more weight loss. Metformin, topiramate, and bupropion were associated with increased odds of maintaining 10% or greater weight loss. Conclusion: Clinically significant long-term weight loss of 10% or more beyond 4 years is achievable in clinical practice settings with obesity pharmacotherapy. © The Author(s) 2023.

However, the real-world effectiveness remains unclear. The magnitude of weight change associated with antidiabetic medication using real-world data was examined. Methods: Patients with diabetes who initiated SGLT2i (n = 906), GLP1RA (n = 782), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i, n = 1881), or sulfonylureas (n = 3255) in Geisinger Health System were identified. Outcomes were percent weight change per year and time to 5% weight loss. Propensity scores were used to account for differences across groups. Results: The mean ± SD age of patients was 57.5 ± 14.1 years, 3381 (49.5%) were female, and 6450 (94.5%) had body mass index ≥25 kg/m2. Compared with sulfonylureas, newer antidiabetic medications were associated with significant weight loss (−3.2% [95% confidence interval: −3.8%, −2.6%] per year for SGLT2i; −2.9% [−3.6%, −2.3%] per year for GLP1RA; and −1.7% [−2.1%, −1.3%] per year for DPP4i). SGLT2i and GLP1RA were also associated with significant weight loss compared with DPP4i. Among patients with overweight or obesity, SGLT2i and GLP1RA users were more likely to achieve 5% weight loss compared with sulfonylureas and DPP4i. Conclusions: In real-world practice, SGLT2i and GLP1RA were associated with significant weight loss compared with sulfonylureas and DPP4i. These results may further motivate uptake of SGLT2i and GLP1RA, especially among patients who were overweight or had obesity. © 2022 The Authors.

Liraglutide 3.0 mg/d subcutaneous injection is indicated for chronic weight management and associated with minimal adverse neuropsychiatric effects. This study evaluated whether liraglutide 3 mg/d reduced body weight, improved metabolic factors and eating psychopathology, and was safe and well tolerated in persons with stable BD who were obese (body mass index [BMI] >30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Methods This was a 40-week, randomized (1:1 ratio), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, 2-arm clinical trial of liraglutide targeted to 3.0 mg/d (in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity) in 60 participants with stable BD who were obese or overweight. Primary outcome was percent change in body weight from baseline to study end. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients who lost ≥5% of baseline body weight, and changes in metabolic variables and measures of eating psychopathology. Results There were no significant baseline differences between the 29 liraglutide recipients and the 31 placebo recipients, except that liraglutide recipients had higher levels of binge eating and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Compared with placebo, liraglutide was associated with significantly greater reductions in percent change in body weight, percentage of participants who lost at least 5% of body weight, and reductions in weight, BMI, hemoglobin A1c levels, binge eating, and hunger. Liraglutide was well tolerated. Conclusions Liraglutide 3 mg/d may be efficacious and safe for weight loss in individuals with stable BD and obesity or overweight.  © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In 2016, the American Heart Association sought applications for a Strategically Focused Research Network (SFRN) on Obesity. In 2017, 4 centers were named, including Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. These 4 centers were convened to study mechanisms and therapeutic targets in obesity, to train a talented cadre of American Heart Association SFRN-designated fellows, and to initiate and sustain effective and enduring collaborations within the individual centers and throughout the SFRN networks. This review summarizes the central themes, major findings, successful training of highly motivated and productive fellows, and the innovative collaborations and studies forged through this SFRN on Obesity. Leveraging expertise in in vitro and cellular model assays, animal models, and humans, the work of these 4 centers has made a significant impact in the field of obesity, opening doors to important discov-eries, and the identification of a future generation of obesity-focused investigators and next-step clinical trials. The creation of the SFRN on Obesity for these 4 centers is but the beginning of innovative science and, importantly, the birth of new collaborations and research partnerships to propel the field forward. © 2023 The Authors.","American Heart Association; obesity; overweight; Strategically Focused Research Network","American Heart Association; Animals; Causality; Humans; New York; Obesity; Overweight; advanced glycation end product receptor; avexitide; azithromycin; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; inositol polyphosphate multikinase; liraglutide; placebo; protein kinase; sitagliptin; unclassified drug; adjuvant therapy; Article; bariatric surgery; caloric intake; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular risk; energy expenditure; glucose metabolism; human; hypertension; inflammation; inheritance; lipid metabolism; maternal obesity; medical education; medical research; medical society; nonhuman; obesity; personalized medicine; postoperative infection; time restricted feeding; weight loss program; animal; causality; medical society; New York; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148479636"

We aimed to explore whether the use of GLP-1A is associated with an increased risk of PC. Methods A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted using TriNetX. Adult patients with diabetes and/or overweight and obesity who were newly treated with GLP-1A or metformin for the first time between 2006 and 2021 were matched 1:1 using propensity score matching. The risk of PC was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results A total of 492,760 patients were identified in the GLP-1A and 918,711 patients in the metformin group. After propensity score matching, both cohorts (370,490 each) were well matched. During follow-up, 351 patients in the GLP-1A and 956 on metformin developed PC after an exposure lag of 1 year. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists was associated with a significantly lower risk of PC (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.52). Conclusions The use of GLP-1A in patients with obesity/diabetes is associated with a lower risk of PC compared with a similar cohort of patients using metformin. Our study findings reassure clinicians and patients with apprehensions about any possible association between GLP-1A and PC.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The metabolic syndrome is associated with abdominal obesity and inflammation and is predictive of long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in otherwise healthy individuals living with obesity. Therefore, we investigated the effects of adherent exercise, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), or the combination on severity of metabolic syndrome, abdominal obesity, and inflammation following weight loss. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. During an 8-week low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day), 195 adults with obesity and without diabetes lost 12% in body weight. Participants were then evenly randomized to four arms of one-year treatment with: placebo, moderate-to-vigorous exercise (minimum of 150 min/week of moderate-intensity or 75 min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of both), the GLP-1 RA liraglutide 3.0 mg/day, or a combination (exercise + liraglutide). A total of 166 participants completed the trial. We assessed the prespecified secondary outcome metabolic syndrome severity z-score (MetS-Z), abdominal obesity (estimated as android fat via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and inflammation marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Statistical analysis was performed on 130 participants adherent to the study interventions (per-protocol population) using a mixed linear model. Results: The diet-induced weight loss decreased the severity of MetS-Z from 0.57 to 0.06, which was maintained in the placebo and exercise groups after one year. MetS-Z was further decreased by liraglutide (− 0.37, 95% CI − 0.58 to − 0.16, P < 0.001) and the combination treatment (− 0.48, 95% CI − 0.70 to − 0.25, P < 0.001) compared to placebo. Abdominal fat percentage decreased by 2.6, 2.8, and 6.1 percentage points in the exercise, liraglutide, and combination groups compared to placebo, respectively, and hsCRP decreased only in the combination group compared with placebo (by 43%, P = 0.03). Conclusion: The combination of adherent exercise and liraglutide treatment reduced metabolic syndrome severity, abdominal obesity, and inflammation and may therefore reduce cardiometabolic risk more than the individual treatments.

This trial compared a targeted prescribing pathway for liraglutide 3 mg with multiple stopping rules in specialist weight management services (SWMS) to standard SWMS care. Methods: This phase four, two-year, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, real-world randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03036800) enrolled adults with BMI ≥35 kg/m2 plus prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnoea from five SWMS in Ireland and UK. Participants were randomly allocated (2:1, stratified by centre and BMI) to SWMS care plus a targeted prescribing pathway for once daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3 mg (intervention) with stopping rules at 16 (≥5% weight loss, WL), 32 (≥10% WL) and 52 weeks (≥15% WL) or to SWMS care alone (control) through an online randomization service. The primary outcome was WL ≥15% at 52 weeks, assessed by complete cases analysis. All randomized participants were included in safety analysis. Findings: From November 28, 2017 to February 28, 2020, 434 participants were screened, and 392 randomized (260 intervention; 132 control), while 294 (201 intervention; 93 control) included in the 52 weeks complete case analysis. More intervention than control participants achieved WL ≥15% at 52 weeks [51/201 (25.4%) vs 6/93 (6.5%); odds ratio 5.18; 95% CI 2.09, 12.88; p < 0.0001]. More adverse events occurred in the intervention (238/260, 91.5%; two deaths) than control (89/132, 67.4%; no deaths) group. Interpretation: A targeted prescribing pathway for liraglutide 3 mg helps more people achieve ≥15% WL at 52 weeks than standard care alone.

Despite this, the impact of intentional weight loss on CV outcomes for persons with obesity and established CV conditions remains poorly studied. New and emerging pharmacologic therapies for weight loss primarily targeting the incretin/nutrient sensing axes induce substantial and sustained weight loss. The glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) liraglutide and semaglutide have US FDA approval for the treatment of obesity, and the application for an obesity indication for the dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist tirzepatide is presently under FDA review. Extensive phase II and IIIa randomized controlled trials are underway evaluating permutations of combined GLP-1 RA, GIP receptor agonist, GIP receptor antagonist, and glucagon receptor agonists. Clinical outcome trials of these therapies in persons with obesity at high risk of established CV conditions should make it possible to estimate the role of intentional weight loss in managing CV risk via these medications. Recent Findings: High-dose once weekly injectable semaglutide (2.4 mg/week) use among persons with obesity and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was effective at both reducing weight and improving health status; exercise capacity was also improved. Ongoing CV outcome trials of oral semaglutide and once weekly injectable tirzepatide will help to establish the role of these therapies among persons with other CV conditions. In addition to these two therapies targeting a CV claim or indication, many other new therapeutics for weight loss, as reviewed, are currently in development. Summary: The impact of pharmacologic-induced weight loss on CV conditions for persons with obesity and established CV conditions is currently under investigation for multiple agents. These therapies may offer new avenues to manage CV risk in persons with obesity and with established or at high risk for CV disease. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Cardiovascular; Clinical trial; Heart failure; Obesity; Pharmacologic; Weight loss","Atrial Fibrillation; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Heart Diseases; Heart Failure; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Obesity; Weight Loss; cagrilintide; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; hu 6; incretin; liraglutide; maridebart cafraglutide; orforglipron; pemvidutide; retatrutide; semaglutide; survodutide; tirzepatide; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; Article; body weight loss; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical outcome; Food and Drug Administration; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; human; obesity; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); randomized controlled trial (topic); United States; atrial fibrillation; body weight loss; complication; heart disease; heart failure; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189209213"

Ablation has a higher failure rate in obese patients, and both the prevalence of atrial fibrillation and obesity are increasingly globally. The outcome of ablation can be improved if obese patients can achieve goal-oriented weight reduction prior to ablation. Conventional weight loss strategies, however, can be difficult to access and can delay ablation, thereby risking a lower chance of maintaining sinus rhythm. Effective weight-loss medications, such as the glucagon-like peptide inhibitor-1 drugs, offer the potential for incremental impact on weight loss over a shorter period of time as a bridging therapy. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of using liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide inhibitor-1, in producing weight loss in obese patients before catheter ablation. Methods: The study is an open-label, uncontrolled, prospective single-centre feasibility study of daily liraglutide injections in the treatment of obese patients for at least 13 weeks before and 52 weeks after AF ablation. Adult patients with symptomatic AF whose body mass index ≥ 30 will be recruited from those planning to undergo ablation. Feasibility will be determined based on the recruitment rate, adherence to the medication, and the amount of weight loss achieved over the study period. Exploratory outcomes include changes in atrial structure, function, and fibrosis with weight loss evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, electroanatomic mapping, and patient-reported outcome measure. Discussion: This study will allow us to determine whether the use of liraglutide in obese patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing ablation is feasible with adequate recruitment. The additional information on adherence and average weight loss over the study period will inform the design of a future definitive randomized controlled trial.

Weight regain during treatment for obesity is a biologically maladaptive response that can be considered a central feature of the disease. This phenomenon has been well documented in patients treated with lifestyle changes and bariatric surgery. In patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg this has been documented in randomized control trials, but real-world analysis is lacking. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to explore the long-term weight outcomes in patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg in a real-world clinical practice. The association between body composition changes and weight outcomes was also explored. The study included 25 patients treated with multi-modal care that included liraglutide 3.0 mg over a period of 78 weeks. Body composition was examined via dual x-ray absorptiometry at 16 and 32 weeks, with body weight captured up until 78 weeks for all patients. Weight loss (R2 = 0.39, p <.001), fat mass loss (R2 = 0.32, p =.003) and fat-free mass loss (R2 = 0.19, p =.03) were all associated with weight change from artificial nadir, which was, on average, 3.8 kg. For body composition, after adjustment, only fat mass loss was associated weight regain (R2 = 0.32, p =.01). In conclusion, in patients with clinical obesity treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg in a real-world clinical setting, fat mass loss was associated with weight regain. Whilst weight regain occurred on average, the magnitude was less than that observed in patients treated with lifestyle alone and weight loss remained clinically significant for most patients. © 2023 World Obesity Federation.","clinical practice; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; liraglutide","glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; novo nordisk; adult; aged; Article; body composition; body weight; body weight change; body weight loss; clinical article; clinical practice; diet therapy; drug dose escalation; drug dose titration; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat free mass; fat mass; female; human; kinesiotherapy; lifestyle; long term care; male; obesity; observational study; outcome assessment; retrospective study; treatment duration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168694643"

Liraglutide reduces total body weight and visceral fat but its effect on muscle fat and adverse muscle composition is unknown. Methods: This is a pre-specified secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that examined the effects of liraglutide plus a lifestyle intervention on visceral adipose tissue and ectopic fat among adults without diabetes with body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 and metabolic syndrome. Participants were randomly assigned to a once-daily subcutaneous injection of liraglutide (target dose 3.0 mg) or matching placebo for 40 weeks. Body fat distribution and muscle composition was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 40-week follow-up. Muscle composition was described by the combination of thigh muscle fat and muscle volume. Treatment difference (95% confidence intervals [CI]) was calculated by least-square means adjusted for baseline thigh muscle fat. The association between changes in thigh muscle fat and changes in body weight were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. The effect of liraglutide versus placebo on adverse muscle composition, denoted by high thigh muscle fat and low thigh muscle volume, was explored. Results: Among the 128 participants with follow-up imaging (92.2% women, 36.7% Black), median muscle fat at baseline was 7.8%. The mean percent change in thigh muscle fat over median follow-up of 36 weeks was −2.87% among participants randomized to liraglutide (n = 73) and 0.05% in the placebo group (absolute change: −0.23% vs. 0.01%). The estimated treatment difference adjusted for baseline thigh muscle fat was −0.24% (95% CI, −0.41 to −0.06, P-value 0.009). Longitudinal change in thigh muscle fat was significantly associated with change in body weight in the placebo group but not the liraglutide group. The proportion of participants with adverse muscle composition decreased from 11.0% to 8.2% over follow-up with liraglutide, but there was no change with placebo. Conclusions: In a cohort of predominantly women with overweight or obesity in the absence of diabetes, once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide was associated with a reduction in thigh muscle fat and adverse muscle composition compared with placebo. The contribution of muscle fat improvement to the cardiometabolic benefits of liraglutide requires further study. © 2024 The Authors.

Antihyperglycemic medications are a mainstay in the treatment of T2DM to prevent complications such as cardiac and renal death. One class of antihyperglycemic medication that has shown benefit for hemoglobin A1c (A1c) lowering, weight loss, renal protection, as well as cardiac protection are the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). These agents bind to the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) promoting β-cell production of insulin, prevent apoptosis and promote proliferation. One limitation with these medications is the method ofadministration being subcutaneous due to the long peptide chains required. This changed when Rybelsus (semaglutide) was approved as an oral peptide GLP-1RA. Growing evidence has suggested that oral small molecule GLP-1RAs may be a new therapeutic alternative with comparable safety and efficacy for both A1c lowering and weight loss when compared to current subcutaneous GLP-1RAs and Rybelsus. This review aims to present and discuss the current clinical and scientific evidence pertaining to danuglipron, a novel oral small molecule GLP-1RA.

We tested the hypothesis that GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists exert weight loss–independent, GLP-1R–dependent effects that differ from effects of increasing endogenous GLP-1. Individuals with obesity and prediabetes were randomized to receive for 14 weeks the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide, a hypocaloric diet, or the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin. The GLP-1R antagonist exendin(9-39) and placebo were administered in a two-by-two crossover study during mixed-meal tests. Liraglutide and diet, but not sitagliptin, caused weight loss. Liraglutide improved insulin sensitivity measured by HOMA for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), the updated HOMA model (HOMA2), and the Matsuda index after 2 weeks, prior to weight loss. Liraglutide decreased fasting and postprandial glucose levels, and decreased insulin, C-peptide, and fasting glucagon levels. In contrast, diet-induced weight loss improved insulin sensitivity by HOMA-IR and HOMA2, but not the Matsuda index, and did not decrease glucose levels. Sitagliptin increased endogenous GLP-1 and GIP values without altering insulin sensitivity or fasting glucose levels, but decreased postprandial glucose and glucagon levels. Notably, sitagliptin increased GIP without altering weight. Acute GLP-1R antagonism increased glucose levels in all groups, increased the Matsuda index and fasting glucagon level during liraglutide treatment, and increased endogenous GLP-1 values during liraglutide and sitagliptin treatments. Thus, liraglutide exerts rapid, weight loss–independent, GLP-1R–dependent effects on insulin sensitivity that are not achieved by increasing endogenous GLP-1. © 2023 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Blood Glucose; Cross-Over Studies; Diet, Reducing; Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Glucagon; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Liraglutide; Obesity; Prediabetic State; Sitagliptin Phosphate; Weight Loss; avexitide; C peptide; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; placebo; protein concentrate plus carbohydrates plus lipids plus minerals plus vitamins; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; sitagliptin; adult; Article; body weight loss; continuous infusion; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; fasting blood glucose level; fasting insulin level; female; glucagon blood level; homeostasis model assessment; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; low calorie diet; major clinical study; male; obesity; parallel design; postprandial state; randomized controlled trial; test meal; body weight loss; glucose blood level; insulin resistance; metabolism; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180499401"

Limited evidence is available on the weight loss effect of combining glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) with endoscopic bariatric therapy (EBT) and bariatric surgeries (BS). Objectives: In this systematic review, we compared the weight loss effect and metabolic changes of combining GLP-1 RAs with EBT and BS. Methods: Literature searches were performed in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PubMed, Google Scholar, and PRISMA databases. Only randomized control trials and retrospective studies were included. Results: A total of 11 studies was included. Nine studies compared BS with and without liraglutide and 2 compared EBT with and without liraglutide. Adding liraglutide to EBT or BS provided significant weight loss when compared with EBT or BS alone. When changes in weight were compared across the studies, EBT with liraglutide showed a weight loss effect comparable to the net weight loss (ie, nadir weight loss after BS-regained weight) achieved following BS alone. Conclusion: This review showcases a promising approach for managing obesity that combines GLP-1 RAs with EBT. This approach is expected to achieve shorter hospital stays, fewer side effects, and longer term weight loss benefits than BS alone. However, additional prospective studies with higher quality, more consistent outcome measures for weight loss and metabolic changes are needed to further evaluate the approach. © 2023 The Author(s).","bariatric surgeries; endoscopic bariatric therapy; GLP-1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; obesity; weight loss","hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; semaglutide; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; body weight change; body weight loss; Cochrane Library; controlled study; data extraction; Embase; endoscopic bariatric therapy; endoscopic surgery; exercise; female; follow up; glucose blood level; hospitalization; human; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; major clinical study; male; Medline; middle aged; quality control; search engine; sleeve gastrectomy; systematic review","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179489544"

We previously demonstrated that the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide significantly reduced glucometabolic disturbances and body weight in prediabetic, overweight/obese schizophrenia-spectrum disorder patients treated with clozapine or olanzapine. This study aims to assess the involvement of cytokines in the therapeutic effects of liraglutide. Methods Serum concentrations of 10 cytokines (interferon-γ [IFN-γ], tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β [IL-1β], IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, and IL-13) from fasting prediabetic and normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were measured using multiplexed immunoassays. Prediabetic patients were randomized to 16 weeks of treatment with liraglutide or placebo, and cytokines were measured again at the end of the treatment. Results IFN-γ (1.98 vs 1.17 pg/ml, P = .001), IL-4 (0.02 vs 0.01 pg/ml, P < .001), and IL-6 (0.73 vs 0.46 pg/ml, P < .001) were significantly higher in prediabetic (n = 77) vs NGT patients (n = 31). No significant changes in cytokine levels following treatment with liraglutide (n = 37) vs placebo (n = 40) were found. Conclusion Prediabetic vs NGT patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine or olanzapine had increased serum levels of several proinflammatory cytokines, further substantiating the link between inflammation and T2D. Treatment with liraglutide did not affect the investigated cytokines. Further testing of these findings in larger numbers of individuals is needed.  © ","Antipsychotics; GLP-1; inflammation; liraglutide; prediabetes; schizophrenia","Biomarkers; Clozapine; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Interleukin-4; Interleukin-6; Liraglutide; Olanzapine; Prediabetic State; Schizophrenia; biological marker; clozapine; cytokine; gamma interferon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; interleukin 10; interleukin 12p70; interleukin 13; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; liraglutide; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; placebo; tumor necrosis factor; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; clozapine; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; liraglutide; olanzapine; adult; Article; blood pressure; blood sampling; body height; body mass; body weight; data processing; disease severity; double blind procedure; electrochemiluminescence; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gene expression; glucose blood level; human; ICD-10; immunoassay; impaired glucose tolerance; inflammation; major clinical study; male; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; schizophrenia; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; therapy effect; waist circumference; controlled study; impaired glucose tolerance; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; schizophrenia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130862300"

Bariatric surgery (BS) has emerged as a promising solution for severe obesity and associated complications, surpassing traditional approaches. Nonetheless, the escalating utilization of BS has given rise to novel challenges, namely weight regain (WR) and insufficient weight loss (IWL). Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have surfaced as a promising therapeutic avenue. Recognizing the potential of GLP-1 RAs in addressing relapse among individuals who have undergone BS is imperative for enhancing patient outcomes. Materials and methods: A comprehensive systematic review was undertaken by searching through databases including PUBMED, EBSCO, ProQuest, and manual exploration, following the PRISMA 2020 guideline. Included were studies that examined the application of GLP-1RAs in individuals who had undergone BS and encountered WR and IWL. Results: This review encompassed 10 studies, all of which demonstrated consistent findings. Irrespective of the diversity in surgical methods, a range of total weight loss (TWL) outcomes were observed. Both primary and revisional surgeries exhibited reductions in body mass index (BMI); emphasizing the overall efficacy of GLP-1 RAs. The collective evidence consistently highlighted the effectiveness and safety of GLP-1RAs in managing post-bariatric weight concerns. Conclusions: Based on current evidence, GLP-1 RA is a safe and effective treatment for post-BS WR and IWL. However, comparison studies using cohort or randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm its effect. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bariatric surgery; GLP-1 receptor agonists; Obesity","glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; semaglutide; Article; bariatric surgery; body mass; body weight change; body weight loss; body weight regain; clinical outcome; constipation; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; endoscopic surgery; gastric banding; gastrointestinal symptom; human; insufficient weight loss; lifestyle modification; meta analysis; nausea; obesity; postoperative period; reoperation; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; systematic review; vomiting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182575109"

Methods: Sixty overweight patients with PCOS were recruited from January 2021 to January 2022 in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University and were randomly assigned to the MET or combination (COM) group to receive 12 weeks of MET monotherapy or MET plus LIRA therapy. Anthropometric measurements, menstrual cycle changes, gonadal profiles, and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted at baseline and after the 12-week treatment. Results: Fifty-two subjects completed the trial while eight were lost during the follow-up. Both MET and COM improved menstrual cycles, anthropometric parameters, and glucose metabolism after the 12-week treatment; however, there was no statistical difference between the two groups. MET plus LIRA therapy improved hyperandrogenemia, including TT (total testosterone), SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) and FAI (free androgen index), whereas MET monotherapy only improved SHBG and FAI when compared with baseline. Furthermore, both MET monotherapy and MET plus LIRA therapy improved E2 (estradiol) while only MET plus LIRA therapy improved LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and Prog (progesterone) more effectively than baseline. Additionally, MET plus LIRA therapy may improve TT, SHBG, FAI, LH and Prog more effectively than MET monotherapy; however, there were no significant differences on E2, FSH and LH/FSH between the two groups. Conclusions: In overweight patients with PCOS, both MET monotherapy and MET plus LIRA therapy improved glucose metabolism and relieved insulin resistance (IR). Additionally, MET plus LIRA therapy was more effective than MET monotherapy in improving reproductive abnormalities and hyperandrogenemia, potentially by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

If neither achieve metabolic control, then the recommendation is to combine both drugs. The evidence base for combining glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor analogues and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors is not well researched, and hence, the impact of the guidelines is limited. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to test the impact of the combination of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor analogues/sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors on body weight and kidney damage, in patients with type 1 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. In addition, we will explore the associated changes in the metabolic pathways with each of the treatments used in this randomized controlled trial. Methods: In this 6-month randomized control trial, 60 participants aged between 21 and 65 years, with a body mass index above 25 kg/m2, and type 1 diabetics with chronic kidney disease will be randomized to receive 1 of 5 possible treatments: (1) standard care (control), (2) glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor analogues alone, (3) sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors alone, (4) combination of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor analogues and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and (5) combination of glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor analogues and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors with intensive lifestyle advice. The primary objective will be the percentage change in total body weight from baseline at 6 months. The secondary objectives are to compare the change in glycaemia; blood pressure; dyslipidaemia; albuminuria; proportion of participants reaching weight loss of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10% and ≥ 15%; and change in BMI (kg/m2) from baseline and change in waist circumference (cm). All the experiments will be conducted at the Dasman Diabetes Institute after approval from the local research and ethics committee. Discussion: The present randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the impact of the combination of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor analogues and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors on body weight and kidney damage in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, as well as exploring the associated changes in the metabolic pathways with each of the treatments used. This study addresses the current gap in the evidence base regarding the combination of these two drugs, which is particularly relevant given the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines recommending their combined use for patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease who do not achieve metabolic control with either drug alone.

We aimed to explore the early metabolomic changes in response to GLP-1RA (liraglutide) therapy vs. placebo and in comparison to bariatric surgery. Methods: Three clinical studies were conducted: a bariatric surgery cohort study of participants with morbid obesity who underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) studied over four and twelve weeks, and two randomized placebo-controlled, crossover double blind studies of liraglutide vs. placebo administration in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and participants with obesity studied for three and five weeks, respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-derived metabolomic data were assessed in all eligible participants who completed all the scheduled in-clinic visits. The primary outcome of the study was to explore the changes of the metabolome among participants with obesity with and without T2D receiving the GLP-1RA liraglutide vs. placebo and participants with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery during the three to five-week study period. In addition, we assessed the bariatric surgery effects longitudinally over the twelve weeks of the study and the differences between the bariatric surgery subgroups on the metabolome. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT03851874, NCT01562678 and NCT02944500. Results: Bariatric surgery had a more pronounced effect on weight and body mass index reduction (−14.19 ± 5.27 kg and − 5.19 ± 5.27, respectively, p < 0.001 for both) and resulted in more pronounced metabolomic and lipidomic changes compared to liraglutide therapy at four weeks postoperatively. Significant changes were observed in lipoprotein parameters, inflammatory markers, ketone bodies, citrate, and branched-chain amino acids after the first three to five weeks of intervention. After adjusting for the amount of weight loss, a significant difference among the study groups remained only for acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and citrate (p < 0.05 after FDR correction). Glucose levels were significantly reduced in all intervention groups but mainly in the T2D group receiving GLP-1RA treatment. After adjusting for weight loss, only glucose levels remained significant (p = 0.001 after FDR correction), mainly due to the glucose change in the T2D group receiving GLP-1RA. Similar results with those observed at four weeks were observed in the surgical group when delta changes at twelve weeks were assessed. Comparing the two types of bariatric surgery, an intervention effect was more pronounced in the RYGB subgroup regarding total triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein size, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (p for intervention: 0.031, 0.028, 0.036, respectively). However, after applying FDR correction, these changes deemed to be only suggestive; only time effects remained significant with no significant changes persisting in relation to the types of bariatric surgery. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the early metabolomic, lipid and lipoprotein changes observed between liraglutide treatment and bariatric surgery are similar and result largely from the changes in patients' body weight. Specific changes observed in the short-term post-surgical period between bariatric vs. nonsurgical treated participants, i.e., acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and citrate changes, may reflect changes in patient diets and calorie intake indicating potential calorie and diet-driven metabolomics/lipidomic effects in the short-term postoperatively. Significant differences observed between SG and RYGB need to be confirmed and extended by future studies. © 2022 The Authors","Bariatric surgery; Diabetes Type 2; GLP-1RA; Lipid; Lipoprotein; Liraglutide; Metabolome; Metabolomic; Obesity; Roux-En-Y gastric bypass; Sleeve Gastrectomy","3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Acetoacetates; Citrates; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gastrectomy; Gastric Bypass; Glucose; Humans; Lipoproteins; Liraglutide; Obesity, Morbid; Weight Loss; 3 hydroxybutyric acid; acetoacetic acid; branched chain amino acid; citric acid; glucose; ketone body; lipid; lipoprotein; liraglutide; placebo; triacylglycerol; trimethylamine oxide; 3 hydroxybutyric acid; acetoacetic acid; acetoacetic acid derivative; citric acid; glucose; lipoprotein; liraglutide; adult; age; Article; bariatric surgery; body mass; body weight loss; caloric intake; clinical article; cohort analysis; demographics; glucose level; human; intermethod comparison; metabolomics; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; obesity; postoperative period; randomized controlled trial (topic); Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; controlled study; gastrectomy; gastric bypass surgery; morbid obesity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; randomized controlled trial","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142122689"

The random-effect model was used to pool data extracted from included literatures. The weighted mean difference (WMD), odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to present the meta-analysis results (PROSPERO registration number: CRD 42020173199). The sources of intertrial heterogeneity, bias and the robustness of results were evaluated by subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and regression analysis, respectively. A total of 24 RCTs were recruited in the present analysis which included 5867 patients. The results showed that the treatment of overweight/obese patients without diabetes with GLP-1RAs including liraglutide, exenatide and semaglutide significantly achieved greater weight loss than placebo [WMD=-5.39, 95% CI (-6.82, -3.96)] and metformin [WMD=-5.46, 95% CI (-5.87, -5.05)]. The subgroup analysis showed that semaglutide displayed the most obvious antiobesity effect in terms of weight loss, the reduction of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). However, GLP-1RAs treatments had more gastrointestinal adverse events (such as nausea and vomiting) than placebo and Met. The subgroup analysis also represented that semaglutide displayed the lowest risk of gastrointestinal adverse events among three kinds of GLP-1RAs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that GLP-1RA had a superior antiobesity effect than placebo/Met in overweight/obese patients without diabetes in terms of body weight, BMI, and WC, especially for semaglutide, which had more obvious antiobesity effect and lower GI adverse events than liraglutide and exenatide. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Objectives: To determine the research trend of scientific publications on the relationship between gut microbiota and T2DM through a bibliometric and descriptive approach. Method: We included originals and reviews related to both topics of gut microbiota and T2DM through searching in Scopus up to 31 December 2019 and then characterized their bibliometric profiles including the number of publications, citations, institutions, journals, countries, and the collaboration network of authors, countries, terms and keywords. Moreover, we performed a descriptive evaluation of the clinical trials based on their intervention type and its influence on gut dysbiosis. Results: We achieved 877 articles (436 originals and 441 reviews) according to our inclusion criteria. The annual publications were constantly increased over time and reached 220 publications in 2019. Out of 436 original articles, 231 animal studies and 174 human studies were found. The majority of human studies were clinical trials (n = 77) investigating the influence of drugs (n = 21), regimens (n = 21), pre/pro/symbiotic (n = 19), surgeries (n = 15), or both drug and regimen (n = 1) on gut dysbiosis. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and metformin were assessed the most in these trials. Obesity side by side T2DM has been assessed in this area of literature based on term and keyword analyses showing their possible similar pathways mediated by gut microbiota. Conclusion: The exponentially growing documents on gut microbiota and T2DM had been published during the last decade and revealed gut microbiota alteration mediated antidiabetic effect of many interventions. Thus, we suggest other researchers to consider this pathway in efficacy assessment of therapeutic modalities and to find the optimal composition of gut microbiota that guarantees healthy insulin sensitivity. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bibliometrics; Gut microbiota; Microbiome; Probiotic; Scientometrics; Type 2 diabetes","acarbose; amoxicillin; berberine; butyric acid; Chinese medicinal formula; curcumin; dapagliflozin; gegen qinlian decoction; gliclazide; liraglutide; metformin; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; sevelamer; sitagliptin; tetrahydrolipstatin; unclassified drug; vancomycin; antidiabetic activity; Article; bibliometrics; clinical evaluation; clinical research; drug efficacy; dysbiosis; human; insulin sensitivity; intestine flora; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; population structure; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; scientometrics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119287907"

OBJECTIVE To review the evidence on benefits and harms of screening children and adolescents for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). DATA SOURCES PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 3, 20 references; experts; literature surveillance through July 22, 2022. STUDY SELECTION English-language controlled studies evaluating screening or intervention for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes that was screen detected or recently diagnosed. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes-related morbidity, development of diabetes, quality of life, and harms. RESULTS This review included 8 publications (856 participants; mean age, 14 years [range, 10-17 years]). Of those, 6 were from the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study. No eligible studies directly evaluated the benefits o harms of screening. One randomized clinical trial (RCT) (TODAY; n = 699 adolescents with obesity; mean age, 14 years) comparing metformin, metformin plus rosiglitazone, and metformin plus lifestyle intervention reported that 2 youths with recently diagnosed diabe developed kidney impairment (0 vs 1 vs 1, respectively; P > .99) and 11 developed diabetic ketoacidosis (5 vs 3 vs 3, respectively; P = .70). One RCT of 75 adolescents (mean age, 13 years) with obesity with prediabetes compared an intensive lifestyle intervention with standard care and reported that no participants in either group developed diabetes, althou follow-up was only 6 months. Regarding harms of interventions, 2 RCTs assessing different comparisons enrolled youths with recently diagnosed diabetes. Major hypoglycemic events were reported by less than 1% of participants. Minor hypoglycemic events were more common among youths treated with metformin plus rosiglitazone than among those treate with metformin or metformin plus lifestyle intervention in TODAY (8.2% vs 4.3% vs 3.4%, P = .05). In 1 study, gastrointestinal adverse events were more commonly reported by thos taking metformin than by those taking placebo (abdominal pain: 25% vs 12%; nausea/vomiting: 17% vs 10%; P not reported). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No eligible studies directly evaluated the benefits or harms screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. For youths with prediabetes or recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, the only eligible trials reported few health outcomes and found no difference between groups, although evidenc was limited by substantial imprecision and a duration of follow-up likely insufficient to asse health outcomes. © 2022 American Medical Association.

However, until 2021, FDA-approved medications for the long-term treatment of obesity in the general adult population had not demonstrated the sustained loss of 15% body weight needed to meet or exceed all guideline-recommended targets for weight-related complications. To meet this need, investigators launched the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program of phase 3 clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of a weekly 2.4-mg subcutaneous injection of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Following the results of STEPs 1 to 4, the FDA approved semaglutide therapy in patients with obesity. This article examines the design, efficacy, and safety of semaglutide therapy as revealed by the results of STEPs 1 to 4. These trials included adults with obesity who reported at least 1 unsuccessful attempt to reduce body weight by means of diet. STEP 2 studied effects on patients who also had type 2 diabetes (T2D); STEPs 1, 3, and 4 excluded patients with this condition. STEP 3 examined the effect of this pharmacotherapy plus intensive behavioral therapy and a 2-step, intensively restricted dietary plan. STEP 4 assessed the effects of continuing semaglutide 2.4 mg vs switching to placebo after an initial treatment period. In the trials comparing the effects of semaglutide 2.4-mg treatment with those of placebo across 68 weeks and in patients with no T2D (ie, STEPs 1 and 3), patients treated with semaglutide achieved a mean -14.9% to -16.0% weight change. This far exceeds the 4.0% to 10.9% weight loss seen with other approved antiobesity medications. In STEPs 2 and 4, the estimated treatment differences between the semaglutide 2.4-mg and placebo arms were -6.2% and -14.8%, respectively. Safety and tolerability of this treatment in STEPs 1 to 4 was consistent with those of other GLP-1RA-based therapies. Ultimately, the results of the first 4 STEP trials demonstrated that semaglutide 2.4 mg is a safe, well-tolerated, and highly effective treatment to promote weight loss, avoid weight regain, and mitigate the effects of the prevalent, chronic disease of obesity. In November 2022, based upon the results of STEPs 1 to 3 and other trials, the American Gastroenterological Association recommended that semaglutide 2.4 mg “be prioritized over other approved [anti-obesity medications] for the long-term treatment of obesity for most patients”. © 2022 Ascend Media.

Pharmacological options for weight management are needed. Objective: To determine whether liraglutide treatment for weight management is superior to placebo/no treatment in pediatric individuals with PWS. Methods: This was a multicenter, 52-week, placebo-controlled trial with a 16-week double-blinded period. Adolescents (n = 31, aged 12-17 years; Tanner stage 2-5) and children (n = 24, aged 6-11 years; Tanner stage <2) with PWS and obesity were included. Patients were randomized 2:1 to liraglutide 3.0 mg (or maximum-tolerated dose) or placebo for 16 weeks, after which placebo was stopped. Liraglutide was continued for 52 weeks. All patients followed a structured diet and exercise program throughout the trial. The coprimary endpoints were change in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) from baseline to 16 and 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints included other weight-related parameters, hyperphagia, and safety. Results: Change in BMI SDS from baseline to weeks 16 and 52 was not significantly different between treatments in adolescents (estimated treatment difference: -0.07 at week 16 and -0.14 at week 52) and children (-0.06 and -0.07, respectively). Changes in other weight-related parameters between treatments were not significant. At week 52, hyperphagia total and drive scores were lower in adolescents treated with liraglutide vs no treatment. The most common adverse events with liraglutide were gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusion: Although the coprimary endpoints were not met, changes in hyperphagia total and drive scores in adolescents warrant further studies on liraglutide in this population.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Semaglutide 2.4 mg, an anti-obesity medication (AOM) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, has demonstrated clinically relevant weight loss in its phase 3 clinical trials. Economic evaluation comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg with other available weight management therapies is essential to inform payers for decision-making. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the treatment of adult patients with obesity (ie, body mass index [BMI]≥30) and adult patients who are overweight (ie, BMI 27-29.9) with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities from a US third-party payer perspective. METHODS: A cohort Markov model was constructed to compare semaglutide 2.4 mg with the following comparators: no treatment, diet and exercise (D&E), and 3 branded AOMs (liraglutide 3 mg, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion). All AOMs, including semaglutide 2.4 mg, were assumed to be taken in conjunction with D&E. Changes in BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol level, experience of acute and chronic obesity-related complications, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were simulated over 30 years based on pivotal trials of the AOMs and other relevant literature. Drug and health care prices reflect 2021 standardized values. Cost-effectiveness was examined with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150, 000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results to plausible variation in model inputs. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg was estimated to improve QALYs by 0.138 to 0.925 and incur higher costs by $3, 254 to $25, 086 over the 30-year time horizon vs comparators. Semaglutide 2.4 mg is cost-effective against all comparators at the prespecified WTP threshold, with the incremental cost per QALY gained ranging from $23, 556 to $144, 296 per QALY gained. In the sensitivity analysis, extended maximum treatment duration, types of subsequent treatment following therapy discontinuation, and weight-rebound rates were identified as key drivers for model results. The estimated probability of semaglutide 2.4 mg being cost-effective compared with comparators ranged from 67% to 100% when varying model parameters and assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: As a long-term weight management therapy, semaglutide 2.4 mg was estimated to be cost-effective compared with no treatment, D&E alone, and all other branded AOM comparators under a WTP threshold of $150, 000 per QALY gained over a 30-year time horizon.

Liraglutide 3 mg is a once daily injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist that is licensed for the treatment of obesity in the general population and has the potential to be used in people with severe mental illness. Aims: To record the expectations and experiences of people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders or first episode psychosis taking daily liraglutide 3 mg injections in a clinical trial for the treatment of obesity. To seek the views of healthcare professionals about the feasibility of delivering the intervention in routine care. Methods: Qualitative interviews were undertaken with a purposive sub-sample of people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders or first episode psychosis with overweight or obesity who were treated with a daily injection of liraglutide 3 mg in a double-blinded, randomised controlled pilot study evaluating the use of liraglutide for the treatment of obesity. Interviews were also conducted with healthcare professionals. Results: Seventeen patient participants were interviewed. Sixteen took part in the baseline interview, eight completed both baseline and follow-up interviews, and one took part in follow-up interview only. Mean interview duration was thirteen minutes (range 5-37 min). Despite reservations by some participants about the injections before the study, most of those who completed the trial reported no challenges in the timing of or administering the injections. Key themes included despondency regarding prior medication associated weight gain, quality of life impact of weight loss, practical aspects of participation including materials received and clinic attendance. Healthcare professionals reported challenges with recruitment, however, overall it was a positive experience for them and for participants.

Increased circulating levels of these molecules have been associated with risk of cardiovascular death. Treatment with liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analog, is associated with weight loss, improved glycemic control, and reduced cardiovascular risk. We wanted to assess (I) potential differences between subjects with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and healthy controls in sST2 and Gal-3 circulating levels, and their relationship with glycemic control and markers of beta cell function and myocardial injury; (II) whether liraglutide treatment modulates these markers in subjects with prediabetes or early T2DM independently of weight loss; (III) whether baseline levels of any of these two molecules may predict the response to liraglutide treatment. Methods: Forty metformin-treated obese subjects (BMI ≥ 30) with prediabetes [impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or both (n = 23)] or newly diagnosed T2DM (n = 17), were randomized to liraglutide or lifestyle counseling until achieving a comparable weight loss (7% of initial body weight). Thirteen subjects were enrolled as healthy controls for baseline sST2 and Gal-3 levels. Results: Baseline sST2 levels were comparable between controls and obese patients (p = 0.79) whereas Gal-3 levels were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls (p < 0.001). Liraglutide treatment, but not weight loss achieved by lifestyle counseling, decreased plasma sST2 levels (− 9%, beta = − 14.9, standard deviation 6.9, p = 0.037) while Gal-3 levels did not change. A reduction in serum hs-Troponin I was observed after intervention, due to a 19% (p = 0.29) increase in the lifestyle arm, and a 25% decrease (p = 0.033) in the liraglutide arm (between-group difference p = 0.083). Lower baseline Gal-3 levels predicted a better improvement in beta cell function after liraglutide treatment. Conclusions: Liraglutide-induced reduction in sST2 and possibly hs-TnI suggests that in obese patients with prediabetes or early T2DM this drug may have a positive effect on (cardiac) fibrosis, whereas plasma level of Gal-3 before liraglutide initiation may predict response to the drug in terms of beta cell function improvement.

Several medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for adolescent use, but the most cost-effective medication remains unclear. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle counseling alone and as adjunct to liraglutide, mid-dose phentermine and topiramate (7.5 mg phentermine and 46 mg topiramate), top-dose phentermine and topiramate (15 mg phentermine and 92 mg topiramate), or semaglutide among adolescent patients with obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation used a microsimulation model to project health and cost outcomes of lifestyle counseling alone and adjunct to liraglutide, mid-dose phentermine and topiramate, top-dose phentermine and topiramate, or semaglutide over 13 months, 2 years, and 5 years among a hypothetical cohort of 100000 adolescents with obesity, defined as an initial body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 37. Model inputs were derived from clinical trials, published literature, and national sources. Data were analyzed from April 2022 to July 2023. Exposures: Lifestyle counseling alone and as adjunct to liraglutide, mid-dose phentermine and topiramate, top-dose phentermine and topiramate, or semaglutide. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (2022 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), with future costs and QALYs discounted 3.0% annually. A strategy was considered cost-effective if the ICER was less than $100000 per QALY gained. The preferred strategy was determined as the strategy with the greatest increase in QALYs while being cost-effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess parameter uncertainty. Results: The model simulated 100000 adolescents at age 15 with an initial BMI of 37, of whom 58000 (58%) were female. At 13 months and 2 years, lifestyle counseling was estimated to be the preferred strategy. At 5 years, top-dose phentermine and topiramate was projected to be the preferred strategy with an ICER of $56876 per QALY gained vs lifestyle counseling. Semaglutide was projected to yield the most QALYs, but with an unfavorable ICER of $1.1 million per QALY gained compared with top-dose phentermine and topiramate. Model results were most sensitive to utility of weight reduction and weight loss of lifestyle counseling and top-dose phentermine and topiramate. Conclusions and Relevance: In this economic evaluation of pharmacotherapy for adolescents with obesity, top-dose phentermine and topiramate as adjunct to lifestyle counseling was estimated to be cost-effective after 5 years. Long-term clinical trials in adolescents are needed to fully evaluate the outcomes of pharmacotherapy, especially into adulthood. © 2023 American Medical Association.

The gut hormones cholecystokinin (CCK), fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), are known to regulate gallbladder motility and may be implicated in gallbladder-related disorders associated with liraglutide treatment. Materials and Methods: In a double-blind, 12-week trial, 52 participants [50% male, age 47.6 ± 10.0 years, body mass index 32.6 ± 3.4 kg/m2 (mean ± standard deviation)] with obesity were randomized 1:1 to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (escalated from 0.6 mg to 3.0 mg once-daily) or placebo. During liquid meal tests performed at baseline, after the first dose and following 12 weeks of treatment, we evaluated postprandial gallbladder dynamics and plasma responses of CCK, FGF19 and GLP-2. Results: Liraglutide reduced postprandial FGF19 after the first dose [area under the curve (AUC)0-240 min 24.8 vs. 48.0 min × ng/ml, treatment ratio (TR) (95% confidence interval) 0.52 (0.39; 0.69)] and following 12 weeks of treatment [AUC0-240 min 33.7 vs. 48.5 ng/ml × min, TR 0.69 (0.52; 0.93)]. Liraglutide also reduced postprandial GLP-2 responses (AUC0-240 min 3650 vs. 4894 min × pmol/L, TR 0.75 (0.62; 0.90)] following the first dose as well as after 12 weeks [AUC0-240 min 3760 vs. 4882 min × pmol/L, TR 0.77 (0.60; 0.99)]. Liraglutide increased postprandial responses of CCK after the first dose [AUC0-240 min 762 vs. 670 min × pmol/L; TR 1.14 (0.97; 1.33)] and following 12 weeks of treatment [AUC0-240 min 873 vs. 628 min × pmol/L; TR 1.39 (1.12; 1.73)]. Conclusion: Compared with placebo, treatment with liraglutide decreased postprandial FGF19 and GLP-2 concentrations and increased postprandial CCK concentrations, which may explain the delayed postprandial gallbladder refilling observed in individuals with obesity treated with liraglutide. © 2023 The Authors.

We retrieved eligible randomized control trials that assessed the weight loss effect of GLP-1 RA in adults (≥18 years old) without type 1/type 2 diabetes up to September 30, 2021, using Pubmed and Embase. Of 36 clinical trials assessed for eligibility, 12 trials were included, with a combined total of 11,459 participants. Compared with control groups, a more significant weight loss was seen in GLP-1 RA groups with an overall mean difference of −7.1 kg (95% CI −9.2 to −5.0) (I2 = 99%). The overall analysis results showed that GLP-1 RA improved glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemic events. Better control of blood pressure and plasma levels of LDL, HDL, and triglycerides was seen with GLP-1 RA treatment. Subgroup analysis showed greater treatment effect of semaglutide than liraglutide.

However, long-term adherence in a real-world setting is challenging, and termination of obesity medication results in weight regain towards pre-treatment body weight. Therefore, we investigated whether weight loss and improved body composition are sustained better at 1 year after termination of active treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, supervised exercise program, or both combined for 1 year. Methods: We conducted a post-treatment study in extension of a randomised, controlled trial in Copenhagen. Adults with obesity (aged 18–65 years and initial body mass index 32–43 kg/m2) completed an eight-week low-calorie diet-induced weight loss of 13.1 kg (week −8 to 0) and were randomly allocated (1:1:1:1) to one-year weight loss maintenance (week 0–52) with either supervised exercise, the GLP-1 receptor agonist once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3.0 mg, the combination of exercise and liraglutide, or placebo. 166 Participants completed the weight loss maintenance phase. All randomised participants were invited to participate in the post-treatment study with outcome assessments one year after treatment termination, at week 104. The primary outcome of the post-treatment assessment was change in body weight from after the initial weight loss (at randomisation, week 0) to one year after treatment termination (week 104) in the intention-to-treat population. The secondary outcome was change in body-fat percentage (week 0–104). The study is registered with EudraCT, 2015-005585-32, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04122716. Findings: Between Dec 17, 2018, and Dec 17, 2020, 109 participants attended the post-treatment study. From randomisation to one year after termination of combined exercise and liraglutide treatment (week 0–104), participants had reduced body weight (−5.1 kg [95% CI −10.0; −0.2]; P = 0.040) and body-fat percentage (−2.3%-points [−4.3 to −0.3]; P = 0.026) compared with after termination of liraglutide alone. More participants who had previously received combination treatment maintained a weight loss of at least 10% of initial body weight one year after treatment termination (week −8 to 104) compared with participants who had previously received placebo (odds ratio [OR] 7.2 [2.4; 21.3]) and liraglutide (OR 4.2 [1.6; 10.8]). More participants who had previously received supervised exercise maintained a weight loss of at least 10% compared with placebo (OR 3.7 [1.2; 11.1]). During the year after termination of treatment (week 52–104), weight regain was 6.0 kg [2.1; 10.0] larger after termination of liraglutide compared with after termination of supervised exercise and 2.5 kg [−1.5 to 6.5] compared with after termination of combination treatment. Interpretation: The addition of supervised exercise to obesity pharmacotherapy seems to improve healthy weight maintenance after treatment termination compared with treatment termination of obesity pharmacotherapy alone. Body weight and body composition were maintained one year after termination of supervised exercise, in contrast to weight regain after termination of treatment with obesity pharmacotherapy alone.

Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 550 individuals with type 2 diabetes (395 in primary CV prevention, 155 in secondary CV prevention), followed at a single center after the first prescription of a GLP-1 RA between 2009 and 2019. CV and metabolic outcomes were assessed. Results: Median duration of follow-up was 5.0 years (0.25–10.8) in primary prevention and 3.6 years (0–10.3) in secondary prevention, with a median duration of treatment of 3.2 years (0–10.8) and 2.5 years (0–10.3) respectively. In the multivariable Cox regression model considering GLP-1 RA treatment as a time-dependent covariate, in the primary prevention group, changes in BMI and glycated hemoglobin did not have an impact on MACE risk, while age at the time of GLP-1 initiation (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03–1.14, p = 0.001) and GLP-1 RA cessation by time (HR 3.40, 95% CI 1.82–6.32, p < 0.001) increased the risk of MACE. Regarding the secondary prevention group, only GLP-1 RA cessation by time (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.46–5.01, p = 0.002) increased the risk of MACE. With respect to those who withdrew treatment, subjects who continued the GLP-1 RA had significantly greater weight loss and lower glycated hemoglobin levels during follow-up. Conclusions: In this real-world type 2 diabetes population, discontinuation of GLP-1 RA treatment was associated to a higher risk of major cardiovascular events, in both subjects with and without a history of CV events. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cardiovascular events; Diabetes; GLP-1 receptor agonists; Real-world","Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Glycated Hemoglobin; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Retrospective Studies; acarbose; antithrombocytic agent; creatinine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; exendin 4; ezetimibe; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; insulin degludec plus liraglutide; liraglutide; lixisenatide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; meglitinide; metformin; mineralocorticoid antagonist; pioglitazone; sacubitril plus valsartan; semaglutide; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glycated hemoglobin; adult; aged; all cause mortality; arterial stenosis; Article; biliary tract disease; body mass; body weight loss; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cardiovascular risk factor; carotid stenosis; cerebrovascular accident; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary stenosis; creatinine blood level; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic retinopathy; diastolic blood pressure; disease duration; disease severity; dizziness; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug hypersensitivity; drug safety; dyslipidemia; estimated glomerular filtration rate; fatigue; female; follow up; gastrointestinal disease; glucose blood level; glycemic control; heart failure; heart infarction; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; hemoglobin blood level; high risk patient; human; hypertension; hypoglycemia; incidence; Italy; lipid blood level; major clinical study; malaise; male; medical history; medication compliance; myalgia; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreatitis; patient compliance; prescription; primary prevention; prognosis; retrospective study; secondary prevention; skin manifestation; smoking; survival rate; systolic blood pressure; tachycardia; time to treatment; treatment duration; treatment withdrawal; triacylglycerol blood level; unstable angina pectoris; cardiovascular disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150989720"

Glucagon increases hepatic glucose production; it also decreases hepatic fat accumulation, improves lipidemia and increases energy expenditure. Pharmaceutical strategies to antagonize the glucagon receptor improve glycemic outcomes in people with diabetes and obesity, but they increase hepatic steatosis and worsen dyslipidemia. Co-agonism of the glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors has emerged as a promising strategy to improve glycemia in people with diabetes and obesity. Addition of glucagon receptor agonism enhances weight loss, reduces liver fat and ameliorates dyslipidemia. Prior to clinical use, however, further studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of glucagon and GLP-1 receptor co-agonists in people with diabetes and obesity and related conditions, with specific concerns regarding a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal side effects, loss of muscle mass and increases in heart rate. Furthermore, co-agonists with differing ratios of glucagon:GLP-1 receptor activity vary in their clinical effect; the optimum balance is yet to be identified. © 2024 The Authors","Glucagon; Glucagon-like peptide-1; Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD); Obesity; Type 2 diabetes","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Obesity; Receptors, Glucagon; bi 456906; cotadutide; dulaglutide; efinopegdutide; efocipegtrutide; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucagon receptor; glucagon receptor antagonist; liraglutide; mazdutide; mazdutide ibi 362ly 3305677; nn 1177; nn 9204 1177; retatrutide; sar 425899; sar425899; survodutide; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucagon receptor; Article; body weight loss; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial (topic); diabetes mellitus; drug receptor binding; dyslipidemia; gastrointestinal symptom; glucose blood level; heart rate; human; muscle mass; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prevalence; safety; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190550594"

RESULTS Of 16,996 participants, 12,928 (76%) were treated with metformin. Concomitant metformin use did not increase the percentage of participants who developed gastrointestinal adverse events or their severity during the observation window. Among participants experiencing gastrointestinal adverse events, metformin use did not increase study product discontinuation. Within treatment arms (GLP-1RA and placebo), a numerically higher percentage of metformin nonusers experienced gastrointestinal adverse events and discontinued the study product compared with metformin users.

We sought to characterize age-related clinical and metabolic characteristics of adults with type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy, prior to treatment intensification. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE), participants were enrolled who had type 2 diabetes duration <10 years, had HbA1c 6.8–8.5%, and were on metformin monotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four additional glucose-lowering medications. We compared baseline clinical and metabolic characteristics across age categories (<45, 45 to <55, 55 to <65, and ≥65 years) using ANOVA and Pearson v2 tests. RESULTS Within the GRADE cohort (n = 5,047), we observed significant differences by age, with younger adults having greater racial diversity, fewer medications for common comorbidities, lower prevalence of CVD, higher weight and BMI, and more pronounced hyperglycemia and diabetic dyslipidemia and with metabolic profile indicating lower insulin sensitivity (inverse fasting insulin [1/(fasting insulin)], HOMA of steady-state insulin sensitivity, Matsuda index) and inadequate b-cell response (oral disposition index) (P < 0.05 across age categories). CONCLUSIONS Clinical and metabolic characteristics of type 2 diabetes differ by age within the GRADE cohort. Younger adults exhibit more prominent obesity-related characteristics, including higher obesity levels and lower insulin sensitivity and b-cell compensation. Given the increasing burden of type 2 diabetes and complications, particularly among younger populations, these age-related distinctions may inform risk factor management approaches and treatment priorities. Further study will determine whether age-related differences impact response to therapy. © 2022 by the American Diabetes Association.","","acetylsalicylic acid; antidepressant agent; antilipemic agent; glimepiride; hemoglobin A1c; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; insulin glargine; liraglutide; metformin; sitagliptin; adult; age; aged; analysis of variance; Article; body mass; body weight; cardiometabolic risk factor; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease burden; drug dose titration; drug response; dyslipidemia; fasting insulin level; female; HOMA index; human; human cell; hyperglycemia; insulin sensitivity; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; metabolic fingerprinting; metabolic phenotype; middle aged; monotherapy; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; prevalence; racial diversity; randomized controlled trial; risk factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141363810"

Materials and Methods: Data from one 52-week, phase 2, dose-ranging trial (once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.05–0.4 mg) and two 68-week phase 3 trials (once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg) for weight management in people with overweight or obesity with or without type 2 diabetes were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model describing semaglutide exposure. An exposure-response model describing weight change was then developed using baseline demographics, glycated haemoglobin and PK data during treatment. The ability of the exposure-response model to predict 1-year weight loss based on weight data collected at baseline and after up to 28 weeks of treatment, was assessed using three independent phase 3 trials. Results: Based on population PK, exposure levels over time consistently explained the weight-loss trajectories across trials and dosing regimens. The exposure-response model had high precision and limited bias for predicting body weight loss at 1 year in independent datasets, with increased precision when data from later time points were included in the prediction. Conclusion: An exposure-response model has been established that quantitatively describes the relationship between systemic semaglutide exposure and weight loss and predicts weight-loss trajectories for people with overweight or obesity who are receiving semaglutide doses up to 2.4 mg once weekly. © 2023 Novo Nordisk A/S.

In the SCALE Teens trial among pubertal adolescents with obesity (NCT02918279), liraglutide 3.0 mg (or maximum tolerated dose) significantly reduced body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score on average versus placebo. That said, liraglutide effects on BMI reduction varied greatly among adolescents, similar to adults. Objectives: To identify post hoc characteristics predictive of achieving ≥5% and ≥10% BMI reductions at 56 weeks with liraglutide versus placebo in adolescents from the SCALE Teens trial. Methods: Logistic regression analysis was performed in 251 adolescents treated with liraglutide (n = 125) or placebo (n = 126) for 56 weeks. Baseline characteristics (selected a priori) included sex, race, ethnicity, age, Tanner (pubertal) stage, glycemic status (hyperglycemia [type 2 diabetes/prediabetes] vs. normoglycemia), obesity category (Class II/III vs. I), severity of depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and weight variability (weight fluctuations over time). The effects of early responder status (≥4% BMI reduction at week 16) on week 56 response were assessed using descriptive statistics. Results: Baseline characteristics did not affect achievement of ≥5% and ≥10% BMI reductions at week 56 in adolescents treated with liraglutide. Further, there was no association between weight variability and BMI reduction. Early liraglutide responders appeared to have greater BMI and body weight reductions at week 56 compared with early non-responders. Conclusions: This secondary analysis suggests that adolescents with obesity may experience significant BMI reductions after 56 weeks of liraglutide treatment, regardless of their sex, race, ethnicity, age, pubertal stage, glycemic status, obesity category, severity of depression symptoms, or weight variability. Early response may predict greater week 56 response. © 2023 The Authors.

Remission of albuminuria occurred in 59.6% (95% CI = 45.5–73.8) after best medical treatment and 69.7% (95% CI = 59.6–79.8) after RYGB (risk difference: 10%, 95% CI, −7 to 27, P = 0.25). Patients after RYGB were twice as likely to achieve an HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (60.2% versus 25.4%, risk difference, 34.9%; 95% CI = 15.8–53.9, P < 0.001). Quality of life after five years measured by the 36-Item Short Form Survey questionnaire (standardized to a 0-to-100 scale) was higher in the RYGB group than in the best medical treatment group for several domains. The mean differences were 13.5 (95% CI, 5.5–21.6, P = 0.001) for general health, 19.7 (95% CI, 9.1–30.3, P < 0.001) for pain, 6.1 (95% CI, −4.8 to 17.0, P = 0.27) for social functioning, 8.3 (95% CI, 0.23 to 16.3, P = 0.04) for emotional well-being, 12.2 (95% CI, 3.9–20.4, P = 0.004) for vitality, 16.8 (95% CI, −0.75 to 34.4, P = 0.06) for mental health, 21.8 (95% CI, 4.8–38.7, P = 0.01) for physical health and 11.1 (95% CI, 2.24–19.9, P = 0.01) for physical functioning. Serious adverse events were experienced in 7/46 (15.2%) after best medical treatment and 11/46 patients (24%) after RYGB (P = 0.80). Interpretation: Albuminuria remission was not statistically different between best medical treatment and RYGB after 5 years in participants with diabetic kidney disease and class 1 obesity, with 6–7 in ten patients achieving remission of microalbuminuria (uACR <30 mg/g) in both groups. RYGB was superior in improving glycemia, diastolic blood pressure, lipids, body weight, and quality of life.

Weight loss is frequently reflected in an amelioration in the severity of the lesions. Case reports have suggested that liraglutide might improve not only weight but also skin. We aimed to study the effects of liraglutide 3 mg in patients with obesity and HS on metabolic and dermatological parameters. Methods: 14 patients started treatment with liraglutide for 3 months. Severity of the lesions was evaluated using the Hurley Staging System and quality of life with the DLQI (Dermatology Quality Index). Results: There was a significant reduction in BMI (39.3 ± 6.2 vs 35.6 ± 5.8; p = 0.002), waist circumference (121.3 ± 19.2 vs 110.6 ± 18.1 cm; p = 0.01), CRP (4.5 ± 2.2 vs 3 ± 2.1 mg/L; p = 0.04), homocysteine (16.2 ± 2.9 vs 13.3 ± 3 μmol/L; p = 0.005) and plasma cortisol (15.9 ± 4.8 vs 12.6 ± 4.5 μg/dL; p = 0.007). Hurley (2.6 ± 0.5 vs 1.1 ± 0.3; p = 0.002) and DLQI (12.3 ± 2.8 vs 9.7 ± 6.9; p = 0.04) improved significantly. In multiple regression analysis, weight loss did not correlate with any inflammatory parameter or Hurley. Conclusions: Liraglutide 3 mg is effective and safe among patients with HS and obesity. Long-term studies are mandatory to assess the effects of liraglutide on skin lesions and inflammatory markers among subjects with HS beyond weight loss. © 2023 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Hidradenitis suppurativa; Inflammatory markers; Liraglutide; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity","Hidradenitis Suppurativa; Humans; Liraglutide; Obesity; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Weight Loss; homocysteine; hydrocortisone; liraglutide; liraglutide; adult; Article; body mass; body weight loss; clinical article; clinical trial; cutaneous parameters; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; human; hydrocortisone blood level; male; metabolic parameters; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; prospective study; quality of life; suppurative hidradenitis; waist circumference; complication; obesity; severity of illness index; suppurative hidradenitis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178560716"

However, the clinical effectiveness of CHM on weight control has not been well studied, while potential risks and adverse effects are still unknown. The aim of our study is to find out a safe and efficient treatment model of CHM for weight control compared to liraglutide in a real-world setting. Methods: we retrospectively analyzed obese subjects [body mass index (BMI)≧25 kg/m2] from Chang Gung Research Database (2013–2018). We evaluated the effect on body weight and BMI changes in obese groups receiving CHM or western medicine (WM, represented liraglutide) within 180 days. The proportion of subjects who achieved 5 and 10% weight reduction was calculated as well. Furthermore, the potential adverse events were analyzed during the study period. Overlap weighting was used to balance the baseline differences between CHM and WM groups. Results: The full cohort comprised 1,360 participants: 701 in the CHM group and 659 in the WM group. At baseline, the CHM group was younger (42.75 ± 12.12 years old in CHM vs. 52.31 ± 11.7 years old in WM, p-value <0.001) and has more female subjects (77.6% in CHM vs. 53.0% in WM, p-value <0.001). On the other hand, CHM users had lower body weight (79.83 ± 15.66 kg vs. 84.68 ± 17.14 kg, p-value <0.001) and BMI (30.58 ± 5.20 vs. 32.84 ± 6.95, p-value <0.001). At day 180, CHM users lost more body weight (−4.5 ± 4.07 kg vs. −2.15 ± 4.05 kg, p-value <0.001) and higher reduction in BMI (−1.77 ± 1.73 vs. −0.9 ± 2.14, p-value <0.001). A total of 53.21% (n = 373) CHM users lost at least 5% of body weight (22.46% for WM users, p-value <0.001), and 18.97% (n = 132) lost at least 10% of body weight (4.55% for WM users, p-value <0.001). The benefit remained consistent with and without overlap weighting. For adverse events, 18 cases of hypertension occurred in 659 subjects in the WM group (2.7%) in comparison to 1 of 701 subjects in the CHM group (0.1%). Conclusion: CHM led to clinically meaningful weight loss without serious adverse events in a real-world setting. Further clinical trials are warranted to validate this result.

Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Hospital-based outpatient endocrine and metabolic center. Patient(s): Women diagnosed with PCOS (NIH criteria) were randomly assigned to LIRA 3 mg (n = 55) or PL (n = 27) once daily for 32 weeks with lifestyle intervention. Intervention(s): Study visits at baseline and 32 weeks included BW and body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Oral glucose tolerance tests were done with sex steroids, free androgen index (FAI), and lipids measured in the fasting sample. Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary end points were changes in BW and FAI. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. Result(s): Change in BW from baseline to week 32 was −5.7% (±0.75) with LIRA 3 mg vs. -1.4% (±1.09) with PL. At week 32, more participants on LIRA 3 mg than on PL achieved at least 5% weight reductions (25 of 44 vs. 5 of 23). Free androgen index significantly reduced with LIRA 3 mg compared with the PL where the mean FAI slightly increased. Gastrointestinal events, which were mostly mild to moderate, were reported in 58.2% of the LIRA 3 mg-subjects and 18.5% of PL subjects. Conclusion(s): LIRA 3 mg once daily appears superior to PL in reducing BW and androgenicity and improving cardiometabolic parameters in women with PCOS and obesity.

Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has lower weight reduction than other bariatric procedures. Liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, improves weight and glycaemic control in patients with T2DM. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.8 mg in participants undergoing LAGB. Methods: GLIDE, a pilot randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, evaluated LAGB with either liraglutide 1.8 mg or placebo in participants with T2DM and obesity. Participants were randomised (1:1) to 6-months therapy post-LAGB, with further 6 months off-treatment follow-up. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from randomisation to the end of treatment, secondary outcomes included body weight change. A sample size of 58 (29 per group) had 80% power to detect a 0.6% difference in HbA1c between groups. Results: Twenty-seven participants were randomised to liraglutide (n = 13) or placebo (n = 14). Multivariate analysis showed no difference between placebo and liraglutide arms in HbA1c at 6 months (HbA1c:0.2 mmol/mol, −11.3, 11.6, p = 0.98) however, at 12 months HbA1c was significantly higher in the liraglutide arm (HbA1c:10.9 mmol/mol, 1.1, 20.6, p = 0.032). There was no difference between arms in weight at 6 months (BW:2.0 kg, −4.2, 8.1, p = 0.50), however, at 12 months weight was significantly higher in the liraglutide arm (BW:8.2 kg, 1.6, 14.9, p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in adverse events between groups. Conclusions: Our pilot data suggest no additional improvement in glycaemic control or BW with LAGB and liraglutide therapy. However, this trial was significantly underpowered to detect a significant change in the primary or secondary outcomes. Further trials are needed to investigate whether GLP-1 agonists, and particularly with more effective weekly agents (i.e. semaglutide or tirzepatide), are of benefit following metabolic surgery.

The aim of the work was to assess the bioequivalence and comparability of the safety and tolerability profile of the drug Enligria® (liraglutide 6 mg/ml, Promomed RUS LLC, Russia) and the drug Saxenda® (liraglutide 6 mg/ml, Novo Nordisk AS, Denmark) after a single dose in healthy volunteers. Materials and methods. This study was an open-label, randomized, crossover comparative study to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. The study comprised 26 healthy volunteers, 26 of whom were included in the bioequivalence assessment population. The study consisted of 2 periods, in each of which the volunteers received either the test drug (liraglutide at a single dose of 0.6 mg) or the reference drug (liraglutide at a single dose of 0.6 mg) once. The washout period between each dose was 7 days. Blood plasma samples were taken to determine the concentration of liraglutide in the range from 0 to 72 hours in each study period. Liraglutide concentrations were determined using a previously validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. A quantitative determination of antibodies to liraglutide in the blood serum samples was carried out using a microplate photometer and ready-made ELISA kits pre-validated by the manufacturer. The conclusion about the equivalence of the compared drugs was made based on the ratio of the parameters Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→t of the studied drug in relation to the reference one. Results. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs were comparable to each other. The resulting 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of the values of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of the Russian test and reference drug were 87.18–110.46, 84.40–104.11 and 86.69–103.22% respectively, which satisfied the criteria for assessing bioequivalence. The tolerability of the drugs in the volunteers was notified as good. The incidence of adverse events was comparable for the test and reference drugs. No serious adverse events were reported throughout the study. According to the results of the immunogenicity analysis, no antibodies to russian produced liraglutide were detected in the blood serum of the volunteers, which indicated the lack of the drug immunogenicity. Conclusion. During the study, the pharmacokinetic equivalence of the test and reference drugs was confirmed.

Materials and Methods: Women with overweight/obesity and pGDM were randomized to once daily subcutaneous liraglutide 1.8 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Participants underwent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and isoglycaemic intravenous glucose infusion at baseline and at 52 weeks, and an additional OGTT after the drug wash-out. Results: In total, 104 women [age: mean ± SD, 38 ± 5 years; fasting plasma glucose (FPG): 5.5 ± 0.4 mmol/L; glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c): 33 ± 4 mmol/mol, bodyweight: 88.2 ± 14.8 kg, body mass index: 31.1 ± 4.3 kg/m2] were assigned to liraglutide (n = 49) or placebo (n = 55). Estimated treatment difference (ETD) for area under curve during OGTT was −173 (95% confidence interval −250 to −97) mmol/L × min, p <.0001, but after wash-out the difference disappeared [ETD 58 (−30 to 146) mmol/L × min, p =.536]. Liraglutide reduced FPG [ETD −0.2 (−0.4 to −0.1) mmol/L, p =.018], HbA1c [−2.2 (−3.5 to −0.8) mmol/mol, p =.018] and bodyweight [−3.9 (−6.2 to −1.6) kg, p =.012]. No change in the incretin effect was observed. The number of women with prediabetes was reduced from 64% to 10% with liraglutide vs. 50% with placebo [adjusted odds ratio 0.10 (0.03-0.32), p =.002]. Conclusions: Treatment with liraglutide for 52 weeks improved glucose tolerance, FPG, HbA1c and bodyweight in women with overweight/obesity and pGDM.

The present clinical feasibility study aimed at investigating the extent to which glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) treatment with once-daily liraglutide 3.0 mg could be a feasible pharmacological treatment of these conditions in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders hospitalised in forensic psychiatry. Methods: The 26-week, open-label feasibility study included participants aged 18–65 years diagnosed with a severe mental illness and hospitalised at a forensic psychiatric department. At the time of inclusion, all participants fulfilled the indication for using liraglutide as a treatment for overweight and obesity. Participants' baseline examinations were followed by a 26-week treatment period with liraglutide injection once daily according to a fixed uptitration schedule of liraglutide, with a target dose of 3.0 mg. Each participant attended seven visits to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events. The primary endpoint was the number of “completers”, with adherence defined as >80% injections obtained in the period, weeks 12–26. Determining whether liraglutide is a feasible treatment was pre-defined to a minimum of 75% completers. Results: Twenty-four participants were included in the study. Sex, male = 19 (79.2%). Mean age: 42.3 [25th and 75th percentiles: 39.1; 48.4] years; body mass index (BMI): 35.7 [31.7; 37.5] kg/m2; glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c): 37 [35; 39] mmol/mol. Eleven out of 24 participants (46%) completed the study. For the completers, the median net body weight loss after 26 weeks of participation was −11.4 kg [−15.4; −5.9]. The net difference in HbA1C and BMI was −2.0 mmol/mol [−4; −1] and −3.6 kg/m2 [−4.7; −1.8], respectively. The weight change and reduction in HbA1c and BMI were all statistically significant from baseline. Conclusion: The study did not confirm our hypothesis that liraglutide is a feasible treatment for a minimum of 75% of the patients initiating treatment with liraglutide while hospitalised in a forensic psychiatric department. The high dropout rate may be due to the non-naturalistic setting of the clinical trial. For the proportion of patients compliant with the medication, liraglutide 3.0 mg was an efficient treatment for overweight. © 2024 The Authors.

The efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity is well established, but their role in the treatment of weight regain after bariatric surgery remains to be defined. Materials and Methods: This was a single centre retrospective observational study conducted at a Swiss bariatric reference centre. Patients with 6 months of treatment with GLP1-RA, up until November 2021, due to weight regain after bariatric surgery were identified. Data on body weight and relevant clinical parameters were collected before and after 6 months of treatment with GLP1-RA. Data are presented as median (interquartile range). Results: Fifty patients (82% female) were included. Before GLP1-RA treatment (liraglutide, n=29; semaglutide, n=21), weight and BMI were 90.5 kg (83.4, 107.9) and 34.0 kg/m2 (31.7, 38.7), respectively, with a post-bariatric weight regain of 15.1% (10.6, 22.8) of total body weight and 4.6 kg/m2 (3.3, 6.2). After 6 months of GLP1-RA treatment, a reduction in weight and BMI of 8.8% (5.2, 11.4) of total body weight and 2.9 kg/m2 (1.8, 4.0) was observed (P value <0.0001), corresponding to 67.4% (40.4, 92.2) of the weight regain. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: For patients experiencing weight regain after bariatric surgery, two-thirds of the weight regain can be safely lost with GLP1-RA, providing clinicians with a therapeutic option for this clinical challenge, and highlights the need for a large-scale randomized clinical trial.

Cagrilintide is an amylin-analog, now being developed in combination with the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide to achieve sustained weight loss in persons with overweight and obesity. Amylin, released with insulin from beta cells in the pancreas, induces its satiating effect via both the homoeostatic and hedonic regions of the brain. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces appetite via GLP-1 receptors in the hypothalamus and increases the production of insulin, and reduces glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying. These separate, but related mechanisms of action of an amylin-analog and a GLP-1 receptor agonist appear to have an additive effect on appetite reduction. Given the heterogeneity and complex pathogenesis of obesity, combination therapy with multiple pathophysiological targets is a logical approach to increasing weight loss response with pharmacotherapy. Cagrilintide alone, as well as cagrilintide in combination with semaglutide have shown promising weight loss in clinical trials that supports the further development of this therapy for sustained weight management.

Additionally, we investigated the associations of higher external and restraint eating scores with the sensitivity to the central effects of GLP-1RA. Methods: This secondary analysis of a randomized crossover study in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, consisted of two periods of 12-week treatment with liraglutide or insulin glargine. Using functional MRI, we assessed the relation between baseline eating behavior and the effects of the GLP-1RA liraglutide compared with insulin after 10 days and 12 weeks of treatment on brain responses to food cues. Results: After 10 days, higher emotional eating scores were associated with less pronounced GLP-1RA induced reductions in brain responses to food pictures in the amygdala, insula and caudate nucleus. In addition, higher emotional eating scores tended to be associated with less pronounced GLP-1RA increases in brain responses to chocolate milk receipt in the caudate nucleus and insula. After 12 weeks, there were no significant associations between emotional eating scores and liraglutide-induced changes in brain responses to food cues. After 10 days, baseline external eating scores were associated with less pronounced GLP-1RA induced reductions in brain responses to food pictures in the insula, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. After 12 weeks, baseline restraint eating scores were associated with more GLP-1RA induced reductions in brain responses to food pictures in the insula and caudate nucleus, and with more GLP-1RA induced reductions in brain responses to the anticipation of chocolate milk in the caudate nucleus. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that individuals with higher baseline emotional eating scores are less sensitive to the central effect of GLP-1RA treatment. Additionally, external eating may also decrease, whereas restraint eating may increase the sensitivity to the treatment effects of GLP-1RAs. These insights may help to optimize treatment strategies for obesity and to select patient groups with better efficacy of GLP-1RA treatment. © 2022 The Authors","Central feeding regulation; Emotional eating; GLP-1 receptor agonists; Liraglutide; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes","Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Feeding Behavior; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Obesity; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin glargine; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; adult; aged; amygdala; Article; association; caudate nucleus; chocolate milk; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; crossover procedure; disease association; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug sensitivity; emotion assessment; feeding behavior; female; food; human; insula; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; orbital cortex; process optimization; randomized controlled trial; treatment duration; treatment response; complication; feeding behavior; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122659883"

It is unclear whether these outcomes can be replicated in real-world clinical practice where clinical complexities arise. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of these medications in real-world multidisciplinary clinical practice settings. Methods: We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients with obesity who were prescribed an FDA-approved AOM for long-term use in academic and community multidisciplinary weight loss programs between January 2016 and January 2020. Intervention: We assessed percentage total body weight loss (%TBWL), metabolic outcomes, and side effect profile up to 24 months after AOM initiation. Results: The full cohort consisted of 304 patients (76% women, 95.2% White, median age of 50 years old [IQR, 39–58]). The median follow-up time was 9.1 months [IQR, 4.2–14.1] with a median number of 3 visits [IQR, 2–4]. The most prescribed medication was phentermine/topiramate extended-release (ER) (51%), followed by liraglutide (26.3%), bupropion/naltrexone sustained-release (SR) (16.5%), and lorcaserin (6.2%). %TBWL was 5.0%, 6.8%, 9.3%, 10.3%, and 10.5% at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. 60.2% of the entire cohort achieved at least 5% TBWL. Overall, phentermine/topiramate-ER had the most robust weight loss response during follow-up, with the highest %TBWL at 12 months of 12.0%. Adverse events were reported in 22.4% of patients. Only 9% of patients discontinued the medication due to side effects.

However, children with type 2 diabetes constitute an underrepresented subpopulation with limited treatment options. This meta-analysis aimed to determine more precise estimates of the efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists in pediatric type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Three databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) for trials published until the end of March 2024. The search indexing terms included 3 categories: [1] type 2 diabetes mellitus [2], youth, and [3] glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). Randomized controlled trials in youth with type 2 diabetes (age ≤ 18 years) that assessed anthropometric and metabolic parameters were included. A total of 1119 nonduplicate studies were retrieved, and 137 full-text articles were screened. The data were analyzed using mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. For outcomes with low heterogeneity, a fixed-effects model was used. Otherwise, we applied a random effects model. Our outcomes were Hb1Ac, fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood pressure, weight, and side effects. Results: Five studies comprehending 415 children and adolescents were included. On average, GLP-1 RA reduced HbA1c levels (-1.01%; 95% CI, -1.26 to -0.76), fasting blood glucose levels (-1.88 mmol/L; 95% CI, -2.51 to -1.26), and body weight (-1.6 kg; 95% CI, -2.83 to -0.36). No significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (MD -0.19 mmHg; 95% CI, -3.9 to 3.52 mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure (MD 0.3 mmHg; 95% CI, -2.33 to 2.93 mmHg) were observed. Despite a higher incidence of side effects, withdrawal rates from the studies remained low. Conclusions: Within this specific population, GLP-1 RAs exhibit a notable association with substantial reductions in HbA1c, FBG, and body weight. The administration of these medications is concurrent with an elevated incidence of side effects, which are predominantly gastrointestinal and tolerable.

Following years of slow progress in discovery of safe, effective therapies for weight management, recent approval of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) mimetics, liraglutide and semaglutide, for obesity has generated considerable excitement. It is anticipated these agents will pave the way for application of tirzepatide, a highly effective glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR), GLP-1R co-agonist, recently approved for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Areas covered: Following promising weight loss in obese individuals in Phase III clinical trials, liraglutide and semaglutide were approved for weight management without diabetes. Tirzepatide has attained Fast Track designation for obesity management by the US Food and Drug Association. This narrative review summarizes experimental, preclinical, and clinical data for these agents and related GLP-1R/GIPR co-agonists, prioritizing clinical research published within the last 10 years where possible. Expert Opinion: GLP-1R mimetics are often discontinued within 24 months meaning long-term application of these agents in obesity is questioned. Combined GIPR/GLP-1R agonism appears to induce fewer side effects, indicating GLP-1R/GIPR co-agonists may be more suitable for enduring obesity management. After years of debate, this GIPR-biased GLP-1R/GIPR co-agonist highlights the therapeutic promise of including GIPR modulation for diabetes and obesity therapy. © 2023 The Author(s).

Methods: The study conducted a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 16-week trial of liraglutide, escalated to 3 mg subcutaneously daily in 136 otherwise healthy adults with obesity. Weight, gastric emptying of solids (GES), gastric volumes, satiation, and body composition measured at baseline and after treatment were compared in two treatment groups using analysis of covariance. Results: Liraglutide (n = 59) and placebo (n = 65) groups completed treatment. Relative to placebo, liraglutide increased weight loss at 5 and 16 weeks (both p < 0.05), slowed time to half GES (T1/2) at 5 and 16 weeks (both p < 0.001), and increased fasting gastric volume (p = 0.01) and satiation (p < 0.01) at 16 weeks. GES T1/2 was positively correlated with weight loss on liraglutide (both p < 0.001). After 16 weeks of liraglutide, GLP1R rs6923761 (AG/AA vs. GG) was associated with reduced percent body fat (p = 0.062), and TCF7L2 rs7903146 (CC vs. CT/TT) was associated with lower body weight (p = 0.015). Conclusions: Liraglutide, 3 mg, induces weight loss with delay in GES T1/2 and reduces calorie intake. Slowing GES and variations in GLP1R and TCF7L2 are associated with liraglutide effects in obesity. © 2022 The Obesity Society.","","Adult; Double-Blind Method; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Obesity; Pharmacogenetics; Weight Loss; liraglutide; placebo; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; abdominal discomfort; abdominal pain; adult; analysis of covariance; Article; body composition; body fat; body weight; body weight loss; caloric intake; constipation; controlled study; correlation analysis; diarrhea; double blind procedure; drug dose escalation; drug effect; female; gastric emptying of solid; gene; genetic association; GLP1R gene; half life time; human; major clinical study; male; nausea; obesity; parallel design; pharmacogenomics; randomized controlled trial; satiety; single nucleotide polymorphism; solid; stomach emptying; stomach function; TCF7L2 gene; treatment duration; complication; genetics; obesity; pharmacogenetics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134999979"

The high prevalence of obesity generates the need for payers to identify cost-effective weight loss approaches. Among various weight management techniques, the OPTI (Optifast®) program is a clinically recognised total meal replacement diet that can lead to significant weight loss and reduction in complications. This study’s objective is to assess OPTI program’s cost-effectiveness in Switzerland in comparison to “no intervention” and pharmacotherapy. Methods: An event-driven decision-analytic model was used to estimate the payer’s cost savings through the reimbursement of OPTI program over a 1-year period as well as a lifetime in Switzerland. The analysis was performed on a broad population of people with obesity with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 30 kg/m2 following the OPTI program vs two comparators (liraglutide and “no intervention”). The model incorporated a higher risk of complications due to an increased BMI and their related healthcare costs. Data sources included published literature, clinical trials, official Swiss price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The primary perspective was that of a Swiss payer. Scenario analyses – for example, for patients with existing complications (such as myocardial infarc-tion, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus) or severe obesity – were conducted to test the robustness of the results. Results: The OPTI program results in cost savings of CHF 20,886 (€ 18,724) and CHF 15,382 (€ 13,790) per person compared with “no intervention” and liraglutide 3 mg, respec-tively. In addition, OPTI program led to 1.133 and 0.734 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained respectively against its comparators. Scenario analyses showed similar outcomes with cost savings and QALYs gained. Conclusion: OPTI program is a dominant strategy compared to “no intervention” and liraglutide 3 mg as it leads to both cost savings and QALY gain. Therefore, reimbursing the OPTI program for patients with obesity would be cost-effective for Swiss payers. © 2021 Nuijten et al.","Cost-effectiveness; Obesity; OPTI program; Total meal replacement","liraglutide; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; clinical trial (topic); comparative study; complication; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; diet therapy; disease severity; event driven decision analytic model; female; health care cost; heart infarction; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; meal replacement program; medical literature; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; population statistics; publication; quality of life; reimbursement; Switzerland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110837494"

Obesity is imposing an increasing health burden in rich and poor nations, with almost 30% of people globally now either obese or overweight - a staggering 2.1 billion. The link between obesity and T2DM is widely held to involve two adverse effects: obesity-induced insulin resistance and β-cell failure. This “unified field theory” raises questions about whether defects favoring progressive weight gain and metabolic impairment also contribute to β-cell decompensation. The concept of weight-centric management of T2DM is considered justified because of the strong negative impact of obesity on the effects of treatment of diabetes. Two pharmacotherapy options are considered: drugs developed primarily for blood glucose control that also exert a favorable effect on body weight and drugs developed primarily to induce weight loss that also have a favorable effect on glycemia. Treating hunger counter-regulatory mechanisms will have an additional effect on glucose control in T2DM. This narrative review addresses advances in pharmacotherapy for the management of obesity and obesity-related co-morbidities, with a focus on T2DM. It is also important to identify the correct balance between weight-centric and glucose-centric management of T2DM. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cardiovascular risk; Obesity; Pharmacotherapy; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Weight loss; Weight-centric management","Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Life Style; Obesity; albiglutide; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; dulaglutide; empagliflozin; ertugliflozin; exendin 4; gelesis 100; glucose; incretin; insulin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; pramlintide; semaglutide; sitagliptin; topiramate; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; Article; blood glucose monitoring; body weight; body weight gain; body weight loss; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial (topic); comorbidity; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; hunger; lifestyle modification; managed care; meta analysis (topic); non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; obesity management; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); regulatory mechanism; systematic review; weight centric management; cardiovascular disease; complication; diabetic complication; lifestyle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085767859"

Materials and methods: A 26-week randomized placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.8 mg daily in 44 overweight adults with insulin pump-treated T1D and glucose levels above target, and demonstrated significant glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)- and body weight-reducing effects. For secondary outcome analysis, dual X-ray absorptiometry scans were completed at Weeks 0 and 26, and questionnaire-based food frequency recordings were obtained at Weeks 0, 13 and 26 to characterize liraglutide-induced changes in body composition and food intake. Results: Total fat and lean body mass decreased in liraglutide-treated participants (fat mass −4.6 kg [95% confidence interval {CI} −5.7; −3.5], P < 0.001; lean mass −2.5 kg [95% CI −3.2;-1.7], P < 0.001), but remained stable in placebo-treated participants (fat mass −0.3 kg [95% CI −1.3;0.8], P = 0.604; lean mass 0.0 kg [95% CI −0.7;0.7]; P = 0.965 [between-group P values <0.001]). Participants reduced their energy intake numerically more in the liraglutide arm (−1.1 MJ [95% CI −2.0;-0.02], P = 0.02) than in the placebo arm (−0.9 MJ [95% CI −2.0;0.1], P = 0.22), but the between-group difference was statistically insignificant (P = 0.42). However, energy derived from added sugars decreased by 27% in the liraglutide arm compared with an increase of 14% in the placebo arm (P = 0.004). Conclusions: Liraglutide lowered fat and lean body mass compared with placebo. Further, liraglutide reduced intake of added sugars.

Methods: In total, 89 patients treated using dulaglutide (0.75 mg, once a weekly) were investigated. The subjects were divided into the three groups based on the form in which therapy was started: additional therapy (n = 35), switched from dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (n = 32) and switched from daily glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs, n = 30). The changes in medication adherence were determined in the daily GLP-1 RAs group using questionnaire surveys. Results: The HbA1c values significantly decreased after the initiation of dulaglutide in all groups (additional therapy group, − 1.4 ± 1.6%; DPP-4 inhibitors group, − 1.2 ± 1.3%; and daily GLP-1 RAs group, − 0.5 ± 0.7%). Forty-six percent of the subjects in the daily GLP-1 RAs group reported that the incidence of forgetting injections of GLP-1 RA was decreased. The reduction of HbA1c was significantly greater in the subjects who reported a decrease in the incidence of forgetting injections (0.9 ± 0.9%) in comparison to those in which there was no change (0.1 ± 0.4%). Conclusions: Dulaglutide is considered effective in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control, regardless of whether their pretreatment includes daily GLP-1 RA treatment. © 2021, The Japan Diabetes Society.","Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor; Dulaglutide; Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; Injection therapy; Medication adherence","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; incretin; insulin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; low density lipoprotein; metformin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea; adult; albumin to creatinine ratio; angiography; anorexia; Article; cerebrovascular disease; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; current drinker; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic retinopathy; diarrhea; diastolic blood pressure; drug withdrawal; electrocardiogram; estimated glomerular filtration rate; fatigue; glycemic control; human; human experiment; hypesthesia; ischemic heart disease; ischemic stroke; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medication compliance; middle aged; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; observational study; ophthalmoscopy; pancreas cancer; paresthesia; peripheral occlusive artery disease; prostate cancer; pruritus; questionnaire; rash; skin disease; systolic blood pressure; uric acid blood level","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105483787"

An additional objective was to examine the effects of varying resistance training frequencies (days per week) on FFM retention. Methods: This prospective study examined patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 receiving treatment in a tertiary care obesity clinic. Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) was captured at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment. Exercise-related data (aerobic minutes per week and resistance training frequency) were captured at week 16. A total of 78 individuals were examined in two groups, the first with lifestyle intervention alone (n = 19) and the second with lifestyle intervention plus liraglutide 3.0 mg (n = 59). Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine between-group differences. Results: Compared with lifestyle intervention alone, participants on liraglutide lost more weight (−12.2 kg vs. −9.7 kg, P = 0.048) and FFM (−2.3 kg vs. −1.5 kg, P = 0.06). After controlling for weight loss, there was no difference in FFM loss between groups (0.14 kg/wk vs. −0.09 kg/wk, P = 0.12). Absolute weight loss (kilograms) was associated with FFM loss (kilograms) (ρ = 0.58, P < 0.0001). Exercise did not increase weight loss, and resistance training frequency (days per week) did not attenuate FFM loss. Conclusions: Liraglutide does not have effects on FFM beyond what can be expected from total weight loss. Resistance training did not attenuate FFM loss in the liraglutide or lifestyle-alone groups. To ameliorate FFM loss after liraglutide, a new strategy may be needed that may combine exercise with specific nutritional interventions. © 2021 The Obesity Society","","Adult; Aged; Body Composition; Body Weight; Combined Modality Therapy; Diet, Reducing; Female; Humans; Life Style; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Obesity; Resistance Training; Risk Reduction Behavior; Weight Loss; Weight Reduction Programs; liraglutide; liraglutide; adult; aerobic exercise; Article; body composition; body mass; body weight loss; caloric restriction; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug dose escalation; drug dose titration; drug effect; drug response; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat free mass; female; human; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; middle aged; obesity; prospective study; resistance training; treatment response; aged; body weight; drug effect; lifestyle; low calorie diet; metabolism; multimodality cancer therapy; obesity; pathology; procedures; risk reduction; skeletal muscle; weight loss program","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100160905"

The antidiabetic and body weight lowering glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has shown to mitigate overweight and impaired glucose tolerance associated with olanzapine and clozapine. As liraglutide has been proposed to affect bone metabolism, we evaluated the effect of liraglutide on bone turnover markers (BTM) in patients with prediabetes and schizophrenia treated with olanzapine or clozapine. Patients diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder treated with the antipsychotic compounds clozapine and/or olanzapine, having prediabetes and a BMI above 27 kg/m2 were randomized to 16 weeks of treatment with liraglutide or placebo. Fasting state serum sampled in the morning from patients (n=78) were analysed for the BTM collagen type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP). After 16 weeks of treatment, no significant changes of neither P1NP nor CTX were observed when comparing liraglutide to placebo. No association between changes of bone turnover markers and change of body weight were found in the group treated with liraglutide. In conclusion, no treatment effect on CTX nor P1NP was observed, and thus, this study does not raise any concerns in patients with schizophrenia and prediabetes treated with liraglutide regarding bone-related adverse effects. © 2020","Antipsychotics; Bone metabolism; Collagen type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX); procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP)","Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Biomarkers; Body Weight; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Bone Remodeling; Clozapine; Collagen Type I; Fasting; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Olanzapine; Overweight; Prediabetic State; Schizophrenia; amino terminal telopeptide; carboxy terminal telopeptide; clozapine; liraglutide; olanzapine; placebo; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; clozapine; collagen type 1; liraglutide; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; adult; Article; body mass; body weight; bone metabolism; bone turnover; controlled study; drug dose titration; fasting; female; glucose tolerance; human; impaired glucose tolerance; major clinical study; male; obesity; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; schizophrenia; study design; blood; bone; bone density; bone remodeling; diet restriction; drug effect; impaired glucose tolerance; metabolism; middle aged; schizophrenia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098222746"

Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the role of dysregulation in the AT metabolome on vascular redox signaling and cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: A screen was conducted for metabolites differentially secreted by thoracic AT (ThAT) and subcutaneous AT in obese patients with atherosclerosis (n = 48), and these metabolites were then linked with dysregulated vascular redox signaling in 633 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The underlying mechanisms were explored in human aortic endothelial cells, and their clinical value was tested against hard clinical endpoints. Results: Because ThAT volume was associated significantly with arterial oxidative stress, there were significant differences in sphingolipid secretion between ThAT and subcutaneous AT, with C16:0-ceramide and derivatives being the most abundant species released within adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles. High ThAT sphingolipid secretion was significantly associated with reduced endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability and increased superoxide generated in human vessels. Circulating C16:0-ceramide correlated positively with ThAT ceramides, dysregulated vascular redox signaling, and increased systemic inflammation in 633 patients with atherosclerosis. Exogenous C16:0-ceramide directly increased superoxide via tetrahydrobiopterin-mediated endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling and dysregulated protein phosphatase 2 in human aortic endothelial cells. High plasma C16:0-ceramide and its glycosylated derivative were independently related with increased risk for cardiac mortality (adjusted hazard ratios: 1.394; 95% confidence interval: 1.030 to 1.886; p = 0.031 for C16:0-ceramide and 1.595; 95% confidence interval: 1.042 to 2.442; p = 0.032 for C16:0-glycosylceramide per 1 SD). In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 1-year treatment of obese patients with the glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide suppressed plasma C16:0-ceramide and C16:0-glycosylceramide changes compared with control subjects. Conclusions: These results demonstrate for the first time in humans that AT-derived ceramides are modifiable regulators of vascular redox state in obesity, with a direct impact on cardiac mortality in advanced atherosclerosis.

Materials and methods: In a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial liraglutide (1.8 mg) and sitagliptin (100 mg) were compared in asymptomatic, non-insulin treated young (aged 18-50 years) adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome was difference in circumferential peak early diastolic strain rate change (PEDSR), a biomarker of cardiac diastolic dysfunction 26 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes included other indices of cardiac structure and function, HbA1c and body weight. Results: Seventy-six participants were randomized (54% female, mean ± SD age 44 ± 6 years, diabetes duration 4.4 years, body mass index 35.3 ± 6.1 kg m−2), of whom 65% had ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor. Sixty-one participants had primary outcome data available. There were no statistically significant between-group differences (intention-to-treat; mean [95% confidence interval]) in PEDSR change (−0.01 [−0.07, +0.06] s−1), left ventricular ejection fraction (−1.98 [−4.90, +0.94]%), left ventricular mass (+1.14 [−5.23, +7.50] g) or aortic distensibility (−0.35 [−0.98, +0.28] mmHg−1 × 10−3) after 26 weeks. Reductions in HbA1c (−4.57 [−9.10, −0.37] mmol mol−1) and body weight (−3.88 [−5.74, −2.01] kg) were greater with liraglutide. Conclusion: There were no differences in cardiovascular structure or function after short-term use of liraglutide and sitagliptin in younger adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Longer studies in patients with more severe cardiac dysfunction may be necessary before definitive conclusions can be made about putative pleiotropic properties of incretin-based therapies. © 2020 The Authors.

Currently, there are only few established drugs for treating adolescent obesity. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological interventions in children with obesity are scarce; therefore, we aimed to analyze the relative efficacy and adverse reactions of these drugs and compare the effects of each drug on body mass index (BMI). Research design and methods: This meta-analysis focused on the slimming effect, safety, and correlation of metformin, orlistat, exenatide, liraglutide, and topiramate in children with obesity. Several international databases were searched and clinical trials on the treatment of obesity in children in which the drug was administered for ≥ 6 months were included. Changes in BMI before and after treatment were analyzed using a Bayes framework, and the surface under the cumulative ranking was calculated. Results: Of 2102 relevant articles retrieved, 21 RCTs were included in the study. Compared to other drugs, liraglutide reduced BMI the most in children with obesity. However, it was most associated with drug withdrawal due to adverse events while topiramate was least. Conclusions: Liraglutide had a higher probability of achieving clinically significant weight loss compared with other drugs while topiramate was superior in safety. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescent; anti-obesity agents; child; meta-analysis; obesity; weight loss","Adolescent; Anti-Obesity Agents; Child; Exenatide; Humans; Liraglutide; Metformin; Obesity; Orlistat; Topiramate; Weight Loss; exendin 4; liraglutide; metformin; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; antiobesity agent; exendin 4; liraglutide; metformin; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; adolescent; Article; body mass; body weight loss; child; childhood obesity; controlled study; drug safety; drug withdrawal; female; human; insulin resistance; male; meta analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; unspecified side effect; body weight loss; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138241684"

These international, randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigated liraglutide and semaglutide (both subcutaneous) in patients with T2D and at high risk of CV events. In post hoc analyses, patients were categorized by baseline BMI (<25, ≥25-<30, ≥30-<35 and ≥35 kg/m2), and CV and kidney outcomes with GLP-1 RA versus placebo were analysed. All baseline BMI data from LEADER (n = 9331) and SUSTAIN 6 (n = 3290) were included (91% and 92% of patients with overweight or obesity, respectively). In SUSTAIN 6, nominally significant heterogeneity of semaglutide efficacy by baseline BMI was observed for CV death/myocardial infarction/stroke (major adverse CV events, primary outcome of both; Pinteraction =.02); otherwise, there was no statistical heterogeneity for either GLP-1 RA versus placebo across BMI categories for key CV and kidney outcomes. The lack of statistical heterogeneity from these cardiorenal outcomes implies that liraglutide and semaglutide may be beneficial for many patients and is probable not to depend on their baseline BMI, but further study is needed. © 2020 The Authors.

Obesity is commonly seen concomitantly with COPD. People with COPD have reduced quality of life, reduced physical activity, chronic respiratory symptoms, and may suffer from frequent clinical exacerbations. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) approved for weight loss and treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, liraglutide exerts anti-inflammatory actions by reducing IL-6 and MCP-1 levels. We investigated the effect of liraglutide on pulmonary function in people suffering from obesity and COPD. Patients and Methods: In this controlled, double-blind trial, 40 people with obesity and COPD from two outpatient clinics were allocated randomly to receive liraglutide (3.0 mg, s.c.) or placebo (s.c.) for 40 weeks. At baseline and after 4, 20, 40, and 44 weeks, participants underwent pulmonary-function tests, 6-min walking test, and replied to a questionnaire regarding the clinical impact of COPD (COPD assessment test (CAT)-score). Results: Compared with placebo, liraglutide use resulted in significant weight loss, increased forced vital capacity (FVC) and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, and improved CAT-score. We found no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, or 6-min walking distance. Conclusion: In patients suffering from obesity and COPD, 40 weeks of treatment with liraglutide improved some measures of pulmonary function. Our study suggests that liraglutide at 3.0 mg may be appropriate treatment in patients with obesity and COPD. © 2022 Altintas Dogan et al.","COPD; GLP-1 RA; Inflammation; Obesity; Spirometry","Forced Expiratory Volume; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Obesity; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality of Life; interleukin 6; liraglutide; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; placebo; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; adult; aged; antiinflammatory activity; Article; body weight loss; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; controlled study; COPD assessment test; double blind procedure; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug use; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; lung diffusion capacity; lung function; lung function test; male; obesity; outpatient department; parallel design; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; six minute walk test; chronic obstructive lung disease; complication; obesity; quality of life","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125205900"

The present study assessed whether visit attendance, dietary self-monitoring, medication, and meal-replacement adherence were associated with 52-week weight loss with IBT and tested whether these relationships were independent of associations with early weight loss. This was a secondary analysis of a randomized trial in which 150 participants (76.1% female, 55.8% white, BMI = 38.8 ± 4.8 kg/m2) received either IBT alone, IBT with liraglutide 3.0 mg/d, or IBT-liraglutide combined with a 12-week meal replacement diet (Multi-component). In the full sample, visit attendance accounted for 14.8% of the variance in 52-week weight loss and dietary self-monitoring added 14.9%. Only self-monitoring was independently associated with weight loss. In the 100 liraglutide-treated participants, medication adherence accounted for an additional 9.9% of the variance in 52-week weight loss, and both self-monitoring and medication adherence were independent correlates. For the 50 Multi-component participants, meal replacement adherence did not predict weight loss. Early weight loss was associated with higher early and subsequent session attendance and dietary self-monitoring. However, self-monitoring and medication adherence remained important correlates of total weight loss when controlling for this variable. Strategies that help improve self-monitoring consistency and medication usage could improve weight loss with IBT. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Behavior change; Drug therapy; Lifestyle modification; Weight loss","Adult; Behavior Therapy; Diet, Reducing; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Obesity; Obesity Management; Patient Compliance; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; adult; Article; behavior change; behavior therapy; body weight loss; controlled study; diet therapy; drug dose increase; female; human; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; meal; meal replacement; medication compliance; obesity; patient attendance; patient compliance; prediction; self monitoring; treatment duration; behavior therapy; body weight loss; low calorie diet; medication compliance; middle aged; obesity; obesity management; patient compliance; procedures; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085004647"

We aimed to clarify the efficacy of dapagliflozin versus liraglutide in patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods. T2DM patients with overweight or obesity who visited the Metabolic Disease Management Center at Tianjin Fourth Central Hospital from October 2019 to January 2020 were recruited and randomised to receive dapagliflozin or liraglutide for 24 weeks. Changes in blood glucose and lipid levels, blood pressure, and body weight, as well as the occurrence of hypoglycaemia and other adverse events, were compared. Results. 309 patients completed the study (143 in liraglutide group and 166 in dapagliflozin group). After 24 weeks, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FPG), and 2 h postprandial blood glucose (2hPG) levels significantly decreased from 8.80%±1.41% to 7.02%±1.05%, 10.41±3.13 to 7.59±2.16 mmol/L, and 17.90±4.39 to 10.12±2.47 mmol/L, respectively, in the dapagliflozin group, and from 8.92%±1.49% to 6.78%±1.00%, 10.04±2.99 to 7.20±1.63 mmol/L, and 17.30±4.39 to 10.13±4.15 mmol/L, respectively, in the liraglutide group. Changes in HbA1c, FPG, and 2hPG levels between groups were not significantly different. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level significantly decreased from 144.1±19.1 to 139.7±16.2 mmHg (p=0.001) and from 3.21±0.94 to 2.98±0.89 mmol/L (p=0.014), respectively, in the dapagliflozin group. After COVID-19 outbreak, the number of patients taking sleep-promoting drugs increased from 4.9% to 9.4% (p=0.029). Conclusions. Liraglutide and dapagliflozin had strong hypoglycaemic effects in patients with overweight or obesity and T2DM at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dapagliflozin may be beneficial in improving SBP and LDL-C levels; however, further research is warranted.  © 2022 Hao Zhaohu et al.","","Benzhydryl Compounds; Blood Glucose; Cholesterol, LDL; COVID-19; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucosides; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Obesity; Overweight; Pandemics; Treatment Outcome; antidiabetic agent; dapagliflozin; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; thyrotropin; antidiabetic agent; benzhydryl derivative; dapagliflozin; glucoside; glycosylated hemoglobin; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; all cause mortality; Article; blood pressure; body weight; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; glucose blood level; human; hypoglycemia; lipid level; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; randomized controlled trial; sleep quality; systolic blood pressure; complication; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pandemic; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136596320"

However, at what stage in the progression toward clinical T2D does islet autoimmunity emerge as an important component influencing β-cell dysfunction? In this ancillary study to the Restoring Insulin SEcretion (RISE) Study, we investigated the prevalence of and association with β-cell dysfunction of T+ and autoantibodies to the 65 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase antigen (GADA) in obese pre-diabetes adults with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and recently diagnosed treatment naïve (Ndx) T2D. We further investigated the effect of 12 months of RISE interventions (metformin or liraglutide plus metformin, or with 3 months of insulin glargine followed by 9 months of metformin or placebo) on islet autoimmune reactivity. We observed GADA(+) in 1.6% of NdxT2D and 4.6% of IGT at baseline, and in 1.6% of NdxT2D and 5.3% of IGT at 12 months, but no significant associations between GADA(+) and β-cell function. T(+) was observed in 50% of NdxT2D and 60.4% of IGT at baseline, and in 68.4% of NdxT2D and 83.9% of IGT at 12 months. T(+) NdxT2D were observed to have significantly higher fasting glucose (p = 0.004), and 2 h glucose (p = 0.0032), but significantly lower steady state C-peptide (sscpep, p = 0.007) compared to T(−) NdxT2D. T(+) IGT participants demonstrated lower but not significant (p = 0.025) acute (first phase) C-peptide response to glucose (ACPRg) compared to T(−) IGT. With metformin treatment, T(+) participants were observed to have a significantly lower Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, p = 0.002) and fasting C-peptide (p = 0.002) compared to T(−), whereas T(+) treated with liraglutide + metformin had significantly lower sscpep (p = 0.010) compared to T(−) participants. In the placebo group, T(+) participants demonstrated significantly lower ACPRg (p = 0.001) compared to T(−) participants. In summary, T(+) were found in a large percentage of obese pre-diabetes adults with IGT and in recently diagnosed T2D. Moreover, T(+) were significantly correlated with treatment effects and β-cell dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that T(+) are an important component in T2D. © Copyright © 2021 Brooks-Worrell, Tjaden, Edelstein, Palomino, Utzschneider, Arslanian, Mather, Buchanan, Nadeau, Atkinson, Barengolts, Kahn, Palmer and the RISE Consortium.","beta cell function; GADA; impaired glucose tolerance; islet autoantibodies; islet autoimmunity; islet reactive T-cells; pre-diabetes; type 2 diabetes","Autoantibodies; Autoantigens; Autoimmunity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucose Intolerance; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Glargine; Islets of Langerhans; Liraglutide; Metformin; T-Lymphocytes; bicarbonate; C peptide; dimethyl sulfoxide; glucose; glutamate decarboxylase antibody; hemoglobin A1c; insulin glargine; liraglutide; metformin; pyroxylin; secretagogue; sodium carbonate; thymidine; antidiabetic agent; autoantibody; autoantigen; insulin glargine; liraglutide; metformin; Article; autoimmunity; blood glucose monitoring; blood sampling; body mass; cell function; clinical trial; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; follow up; glucose blood level; glucose infusion; glycemic control; hemolysis; human; hyperglycemia; hyperglycemic clamp technique; immunoblotting; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; major clinical study; molecular weight; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet cell; pancreas islet cell function; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; prevalence; retrospective study; scintillation; self report; sensitivity and specificity; autoimmunity; glucose intolerance; immunology; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas islet; T lymphocyte","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105838494"

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and open-label active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study, participants aged 18 to 70 years with a body mass index of 35 to 50 kg/m2 and stable weight were randomly assigned in a 1:1:2:2:2 ratio to blinded treatment with placebo; JNJ-64565111 (5.0, 7.4 or 10.0 mg, each with no dose escalation), or open-label liraglutide 3.0 mg. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent change from baseline in body weight at week 26. Four-hundred seventy four participants were randomized and 343 (72.4%) completed treatment. At week 26, placebo-subtracted body weight changes (adjusted for multiplicity) were −6.8%, −8.1% and −10.0% for the JNJ-64565111 5.0 mg, 7.4 mg and 10.0 mg groups, respectively, and −5.8% for the liraglutide group.

A systematic literature search and review after the Cochrane method identified sources for investigational and approved ADs resulted in a comprehensive database with data from 178 clinical studies in obese subjects and patients with T2DM. Results indicated that there were AD class-dependent effects on HR and SBP, whereas no clear AD-related effects on DBP were found. All AD classes, except for DPP4 inhibitors, increased HR. The largest increase of 12 bpm was seen with GLP1 receptor agonists. All AD classes appeared to decrease SBP. DPP4 inhibitors were associated with a marginal decrease of ~ 1 mmHg, whereas GLP1 and GIP/GLP1 dual agonists exhibited the largest decrease of ~ 3 mmHg in SBP. AD-related effects were similar in obese subjects and patients with T2DM. In conclusion, there are clinically relevant AD-related effects on both HR and SBP, but not on DBP. DPP4 inhibitors are associated with the smallest (if at all) effects on HR and SBP, whereas GLP1 inhibitors exhibited the largest effects on these two cardiovascular end points. Additional studies are warranted to further investigate how AD-related SBP decreases combined with HR increases affect long-term cardiovascular mortality. © 2020 The Authors.

The GLP-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, has shown to induce weight loss and improve metabolic factors, thus modulating factors associated with diastolic dysfunction. We have previously reported the effects of liraglutide on systolic function, and in this current study we explore the effects of liraglutide on diastolic function parameters in patients with stable CAD, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and newly diagnosed T2DM. Methods: Thirty subjects were randomized to liraglutide or placebo intervention for 12 + 12-weeks in this double-blind cross-over study. 2D-echocardiography using tissue velocity imaging was used for assessment of diastolic function parameters. Early diastolic filling velocity (E), late atrial filling velocity (A), E-wave deceleration time (EDT) and E/A ratio was assessed from the pulse wave (PW)-Doppler velocity recording of the mitral inflow. Peak early diastolic annular velocities (e′) was measured from color tissue doppler images. Results: Liraglutide, when compared to placebo, induced a significant reduction in average e′ and lateral e′ velocities (– 0.57 cm/s [– 1.05 to − 0.08] and –0.74 cm/s [–1.32 to –0.15], respectively). Adjusted for the concomitant increase in HR (+ 6.16 bpm [0.79 to 11.54], the changes were not significant. No significant changes in other diastolic function parameters were observed. Conclusions: Liraglutide therapy did not improve any diastolic function parameters in subjects with T2DM, CAD, and preserved LVEF. Instead, a deterioration in e’ was observed, which was associated to an increase in heart rate induced by liraglutide therapy.

Liraglutide 3.0 mg, is one of the possible options for long-term anti-obesity treatment. Research design and methods: We systematically searched the databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. A meta-analysis was then performed using random-effect models. Results: Meta-analyses of seven phase 3 and 4 RCTs (N = 6,028), which were conducted in adults with obesity or overweight for at least 1 year, demonstrated a significant weight reduction with liraglutide 3.0 mg (mean difference of percentage weight change −4.81%; 95% CI: −5.56% to −4.06%; P < 0.00001), relative to placebo. However, more participants taking liraglutide experienced at least one adverse event. More discontinuations due to adverse events were observed among them. In the subgroup analysis among participants with or without diabetes mellitus (DM), pooled result showed that liraglutide was associated with a greater decrease in the percentage of weight change in participants without DM.

In practice, the utilization of weight loss drugs is influenced by various factors, including the cost of treatment. We conducted a retrospective, observational study to assess the effectiveness of liraglutide 3.0 mg and patients' persistence on treatment, in a real-world setting. Methods: Data were extracted from de-identified electronic medical records from an obesity management clinic in Switzerland. Changes in body weight and blood pressure were evaluated in the full cohort (N = 277, 19% of whom had undergone bariatric surgery) and subgroups who were persistent on liraglutide 3.0 mg for at least 4 months (n = 236), 7 months (n = 159), or 12 months (n = 71). Results: Median persistence on liraglutide was 6.8 months. Median maximum dose received was 1.5 mg, and 13.7% of patients reached the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg. Mean 7-month weight change from baseline in the full cohort was -4.1 kg (95% confidence interval: -5.0, -3.2; p < 0.001; -4.2%). Weight change was -4.4 kg (-4.7%) in the ≥4-month persistence subgroup at 4 months, -5.1 kg (-5.3%) in the ≥7-month persistence subgroup at 7 months, and -7.5 kg (-7.1%) in the ≥12-month persistence subgroup at 12 months (all p < 0.001). In the full cohort, 40% and 14% of patients lost ≥5% and >10% of body weight at 7 months, respectively. Weight loss did not differ significantly according to history of bariatric surgery (p = 0.94). Diastolic blood pressure decreased (from 87.0 to 83.9 mm Hg at 7 months; p = 0.018), with no significant changes in systolic blood pressure. Approximately two-thirds of patients did not have health insurance that could cover the cost of liraglutide. Conclusion: In a real-world setting with low insurance coverage and with most patients not reaching the recommended maintenance dose of 3.0 mg, the use of liraglutide, in combination with diet and exercise, was associated with clinically meaningful weight loss.  © 2021 ","Bariatric surgery; Electronic medical records; Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; Liraglutide 3.0 mg; Weight loss","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Obesity; Retrospective Studies; Switzerland; Weight Loss; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; body weight change; body weight loss; body weight management; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; diet therapy; drug efficacy; exercise; female; human; major clinical study; male; obesity; observational study; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; Switzerland; systolic blood pressure; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114435111"

Objectives: This study aimed to perform a population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analysis of liraglutide by meta-analysis of data from trials conducted in children, adolescents and adults with obesity. Methods: The population pharmacokinetic analysis investigated the effect of covariates body weight, age group (children, adolescents and adults) and sex on liraglutide exposure in adolescents compared with previous results in adults. The exposure-response relationship of liraglutide for the change from baseline in body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS) was evaluated in adolescents and compared to that in adults. Results: Body weight was the main covariate affecting liraglutide exposure, with lower exposures at higher body weights, whereas age group was of no importance and sex was of little importance. An exposure-response relationship was demonstrated for liraglutide in both adolescents and adults as the decrease in BMI SDS from baseline increased in an exposure-dependent manner with increasing liraglutide exposure. Conclusions: The population pharmacokinetic analysis supported similar liraglutide exposures in adolescents and adults; body weight was the most important covariate affecting exposure.

Facing overall increasing longevity, high rates of obesity in older individuals (age ≥65 years) and a growing recognition of the health and functional cost of the number of obesity years, abetted by evidence that intentional weight loss in older obese people is safe, this approach is gradually, but not unanimously, being replaced by more active principles. Lifestyle interventions that include reduced but sufficient energy intake, age-adequate protein and micronutrient intake, coupled with aerobic and resistance exercise tailored to personal limitations, can induce weight loss with improvement in frailty indices. Sustained weight loss at this age can prevent or ameliorate diabetes. More active steps are controversial. The use of weight loss medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs (liraglutide as the first example), provides an additional treatment tier. Its safety and cardiovascular health benefits have been convincingly shown in older obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In our opinion, this option should not be denied to obese individuals with prediabetes or other obesity-related comorbidities based on age. Finally, many reports now provide evidence that bariatric surgery can be safely performed in older people as the last treatment tier. Risk-benefit issues should be considered with extreme care and disclosed to candidates. The selection process requires good presurgical functional status, individualized consideration of the sequels of obesity, and reliance on centers that are highly experienced in the surgical procedure as well as short-term and long-term subsequent comprehensive care and support. © 2021 The Author(s).

Materials and methods: Subjects enrolled in the T1D Exchange (T1DX) Clinic Registry age ≥ 18 years with a diabetes duration of ≥1 year were included in the analysis (n = 13,501). Data for participants (n = 37) with bariatric surgery after diabetes onset were assessed before and after surgery and also compared to a matched control group. Data for participants who reported the use of FDA-approved weight loss medications (n = 483) were assessed before starting, during use, and after stopping the medications and also compared to a matched control group. Variables of interest included BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure, lipid profile, rates of acute complications. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Results: Bariatric surgery resulted in BMI reduction from 38.8 ± 9.1 kg/m2 to 33.3 ± 6.7 kg/m2 (P = 0.006) and HbA1c reduction from 8.8 ± 1.3% (73 ± 14.2 mmol/mol) to 8.1 ± 1.1% (65 ± 12.0 mmol/mol) (P = 0.05). Weight loss medications were not associated with weight loss or better glycemic control although stopping liraglutide favored weight gain. Both interventions were not associated with a significant change in blood pressure or lipid profile. There were no adverse events associated with the use of weight loss medications. Conclusions: Bariatric surgery is effective for weight loss and may improve glycemic control in selected patients. Weight loss medications are not associated with diabetes improvement.

These patients are often characterized by obesity and they often experience a more rapid disease progression than adults with type 2 diabetes. Thus, focus on prevention and management of complications and comorbidities is imperative. With emphasis on weight loss and optimal glycemic control, treatment includes lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy, which in this patient group is limited to metformin, liraglutide and insulin. In selected cases, bariatric surgery is indicated. Areas covered: This perspective article provides an overview of the literature covering pathophysiology, diagnosis, characteristics and treatment of pediatric type 2 diabetes, and outlines the gaps in our knowledge where further research is needed. The paper draws on both mechanistic studies, large scale intervention trials, epidemiological studies and international consensus statements. Expert opinion: Type 2 diabetes in pediatric patients is an increasing health care problem, and the current treatment strategies do not successfully meet the many challenges and obstacles in this patient group. Treatments must be early, intensive, multifaceted and durable. Also, prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes in at-risk children should be addressed and prioritized on all levels. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adolescents; children; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; obesity; pediatric; type 2 diabetes","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Metformin; Weight Loss; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; metformin; Article; bariatric surgery; body weight management; clinical feature; comorbidity; diabetes education; diabetic complication; diagnostic procedure; diet therapy; exercise; high risk population; human; insulin treatment; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pediatric patient; pharmaceutical care; adolescent; adult; body weight loss; child; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113796192"

Materials and Methods: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial took place in mental health centres and primary care within Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust. The participants were adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or first-episode psychosis prescribed antipsychotic medication who were overweight or obese. The intervention was once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide or placebo, titrated to 3.0 mg daily, for 6 months. The primary outcomes were recruitment, consent, retention and adherence. The secondary exploratory outcomes were weight, HbA1c and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Results: Seven hundred and ninety-nine individuals were screened for eligibility. The most common reasons for exclusion were ineligibility (44%) and inability to make contact (28%). The acceptance rate, as a proportion of all eligible participants, was 12.2%. The most commonly stated reason why eligible candidates declined to participate related to the study-specific medication and protocol (n = 50). Forty-seven participants were randomized, with 79% completing the trial. Participants in the liraglutide arm lost a mean 5.7 ± 7.9 kg compared with no significant weight change in the placebo group (treatment difference −6.0 kg, p =.015).

Thus, the objective of this study was to emulate a large cardiovascular outcome trial of type 2 diabetes to compare associations of effectiveness with different comparator groups to those reported in the trial. Using the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, we investigated six comparator groups using three calendar time periods (Early: 1999–2003; Later: 2004–2008, and Contemporaneous: 2009–2013) and two comparators (sulfonylureas and other second-to-third-line antidiabetic drugs). Hazard ratios (HRs) of the three-point composite cardiovascular outcome were estimated using four variations of the propensity score (adjustment, stratification, fine stratification, and matching) and compared with the LEADER trial (HR, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.97). When comparing users of liraglutide with users of sulfonylureas, the HRs ranged from 0.57 to 1.03, with estimates in the early period most closely reflecting the LEADER trial (HR, 0.57–0.88). In contrast, the HRs ranged from 0.73 to 0.97 when comparing liraglutide users with users of any second-to-third-line antidiabetic drugs, although the later period generated estimates closest to the LEADER trial (HR, 0.77–0.84). Different methods of adjustment led to generally consistent HRs, aside from the fine stratification in the early period. This study highlights the complex interplay between comparator, temporality, and method of adjustment when selecting comparators using real-word data. These design choices must be considered in the design of trial emulation studies. © 2020 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics © 2020 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics","","Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Clinical Trials as Topic; Decision Making; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Sulfonylurea Compounds; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acarbose; acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; diuretic agent; fibric acid derivative; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; hemoglobin A1c; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; paracetamol; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea; warfarin; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; sulfonylurea derivative; adult; Article; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; clinical trial; clinical trial (topic); cohort analysis; controlled study; decision making; female; hemoglobin blood level; human; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prescription; priority journal; treatment outcome; aged; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial (topic); decision making; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090997806"

Areas covered: This review covers the history of antiobesity drugs, efficacy, and risks of currently approved drugs, limits of their usefulness in clinical practice, gaps in knowledge, methodological limitations of clinical trials, and reasons for underutilization. Expert opinion: In randomized controlled trials, currently approved antiobesity drugs have yielded an average weight loss ranging from approximately 3% to 9% relative to placebo at 1 year. Inadequate inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities and men, and high dropout rates in clinical trials limit generalizability of these findings to clinical practice. Weight loss achieved with antiobesity drugs is generally associated with lowered glycemia, but improvements in blood pressure and lipid measures tend to be marginal. There is limited evidence for sustained weight loss beyond 1 year and for safety and efficacy of antiobesity drugs in children and adolescents, and in post-bariatric surgery patients. None have demonstrated reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events or other significant disease outcomes. Limited health insurance coverage and negative perceptions of physicians have hindered the utilization of antiobesity drugs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antiobesity drugs; bupropion; liraglutide; lorcaserin; naltrexone; Obesity; pharmacotherapy; phentermine; topiramate; weight loss","Adolescent; Anti-Obesity Agents; Bariatric Surgery; Blood Pressure; Child; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Combinations; Drug Utilization; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; antiobesity agent; hemoglobin A1c; lipid; liraglutide; lorcaserin; phentermine; phentermine plus topiramate; placebo; psychotropic agent; tetrahydrolipstatin; antiobesity agent; antiobesity activity; Article; bariatric surgery; body weight disorder; body weight gain; body weight loss; cardiovascular disease; childhood obesity; clinical practice; clinical trial (topic); diastolic blood pressure; drug approval; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug use; drug utilization; ethnic group; glucose blood level; health insurance; human; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; obesity; outcome assessment; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); postoperative care; professional knowledge; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; risk factor; systolic blood pressure; adolescent; blood pressure; child; drug combination; lifestyle; obesity; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083854825"

Research design and methods: A total of 84 adult overweight and obese patients with T1DM, with no detectable C-peptide, were randomized (1:1) to either placebo or 1.8 mg/d liraglutide for 6 months. Blood samples were collected at 0, 12 and 26 weeks. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies, a high-calorie high-fat meal challenge test, continuous glucose monitoring, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and MRI were performed before and at the end of treatment. Results: In all, 37 and 27 patients who received liraglutide and placebo, respectively, completed the study. Glycated haemoglobin fell by 0.41 ± 0.18% (4.5±1.4 mmol/mol) from baseline after liraglutide treatment (P = 0.001), and by 0.29 ± 0.19% (3.1±2.0 mmol/mol) compared to placebo (P = 0.1). There was no increase in hypoglycaemia, while the time spent in normal glycaemia increased (P = 0.015) and time spent in hyperglycaemia decreased (P = 0.019). Body weight fell significantly in the liraglutide group, mostly in the form of fat mass loss (including visceral fat), with no change in lean mass. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) also fell after liraglutide treatment. Liraglutide also caused a significant increase in the expression of adipose tissue triglyceride lipase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α, PPARδ, uncoupling protein-2 and type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase in the adipose tissue. Conclusions: Liraglutide improves glycaemia, reduces adiposity and SBP. Liraglutide also stimulates mechanisms involved with an increase in lipid oxidation and thermogenesis, while conserving lean body mass. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","energy; GLP-1 analogue; liraglutide; type 1 diabetes; weight control","Adult; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Obesity; Overweight; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; C peptide; carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; insulin; liraglutide; oxidoreductase; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; placebo; triacylglycerol lipase; uncoupling protein 2; antidiabetic agent; glycosylated hemoglobin; liraglutide; adipose tissue; adult; aged; Article; body composition; body weight loss; controlled study; drug dose comparison; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat mass; female; glycemic control; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; intra-abdominal fat; lean body weight; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; randomized controlled trial; subcutaneous fat; systolic blood pressure; thermogenesis; tissue metabolism; treatment duration; blood glucose monitoring; body weight loss; complication; double blind procedure; glucose blood level; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087640535"

Materials and Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with trial sequential analysis (TSA). Randomized controlled trial inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM from 1 of these subgroups: elderly, obese, previous atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD), previous coronary heart disease (CHD), previous heart failure (HF), or previous chronic kidney disease (CKD). Randomized controlled trials describing those subgroups with at least 48 weeks of follow-up were included. Outcomes: 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), CV death, hospitalization due to HF, and renal outcomes. We performed direct meta-analysis with the number of events in the intervention and control groups in each subset, and the relative risk of the events was calculated. Results: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were the only antihyperglycemic agents related to a reduction in CV events in different populations. For obese and elderly populations, GLP-1 RA were associated with benefits in 3-point MACE; for patients with ASCVD, both SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA had benefits in 3-point MACE, while for patients with CHD, only SGLT2i were beneficial. Conclusions: SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA reduced CV events in selected populations: SGLT2i led to a reduction in events in patients with previous CHD, ASCVD, and HF. GLP-1 RA led to a reduction in CV events in patients with ASCVD, elderly patients, and patients with obesity. Trial sequential analysis shows that these findings are conclusive.

We evaluated the effect of liraglutide in comparison with placebo on total weight loss (TWL) and excess body weight loss (EWL) and when added in initial weight loss period after LSG in obese individuals. Material and Methods: Participants with BMI > 30 kg/m2 undergoing LSG were randomised to receive either liraglutide (subcutaneous) in increasing does of 0.6 mg/day until maximum tolerated dose of 3.0 mg (L-L group) or placebo (L-P group) from 6 weeks post-operative until 6 months. Weight, BMI, %TWL, %EWL, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, sleep apnea and quality of life were evaluated. Primary end point was %TWL and % EWL at post-operative 6 months. Results: Thirty participants underwent LSG, and 23 were randomised to receive liraglutide (n = 12) or placebo (n = 11).The mean dose of liraglutide in L-L group was 1.41 ± 0.49 mg/day. Patients in L-L group had %TWL of 28.2 ± 5.7 and %EWL of 58.7 ± 14.3 as compared with 23.2 ± 6.2 (p = 0.116) and 44.5 ± 8.6 (p = 0.043) in L-P group at 24 weeks, respectively. BMI decreased by 11.7 ± 3.5 in L-L group compared with 9.5 ± 4.0 in L-P group (p = 0.287). All patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes had resolution of dysglycemia in the L-L group as compared with 50% in L-P group. However, there was no significant difference in resolution of other obesity-related comorbidities between two groups at 24-week follow-up. Conclusion: Liraglutide added early after LSG significantly augments weight loss from LSG in obese individuals.

Methods: In 450 participants with obesity, body composition, resting energy expenditure, satiety, satiation, eating behavior, affect, and physical activity were measured by validated studies and questionnaires. These variables were used to classify obesity phenotypes. Subsequently, in a 12-month, pragmatic, real-world trial performed in a weight management center, 312 patients were randomly assigned to phenotype-guided treatment or non-phenotype-guided treatment with antiobesity medications: phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, bupropion/naltrexone, lorcaserin, and liraglutide. The primary outcome was weight loss at 12 months. Results: Four phenotypes of obesity were identified in 383 of 450 participants (85%): hungry brain (abnormal satiation), emotional hunger (hedonic eating), hungry gut (abnormal satiety), and slow burn (decreased metabolic rate). In 15% of participants, no phenotype was identified. Two or more phenotypes were identified in 27% of patients. In the pragmatic clinical trial, the phenotype-guided approach was associated with 1.75-fold greater weight loss after 12 months with mean weight loss of 15.9% compared with 9.0% in the non-phenotype-guided group (difference −6.9% [95% CI −9.4% to −4.5%], P < 0.001), and the proportion of patients who lost >10% at 12 months was 79% in the phenotype-guided group compared with 34% with non-phenotype-guided treatment group. Conclusions: Biological and behavioral phenotypes elucidate human obesity heterogeneity and can be targeted pharmacologically to enhance weight loss. © 2021 The Obesity Society","","Anti-Obesity Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Female; Humans; Male; Obesity; Precision Medicine; Weight Loss; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; antiobesity agent; liraglutide; lorcaserin; phentermine; phentermine plus topiramate; antiobesity agent; adult; Article; body composition; body weight loss; body weight management; cohort analysis; controlled study; feeding behavior; female; human; major clinical study; male; metabolic rate; obesity; physical activity; prediction; questionnaire; resting energy expenditure; satiety; treatment outcome; validation process; body weight loss; clinical trial (topic); drug effect; obesity; personalized medicine; procedures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102932445"

However, few studies have examined the relative effects of adherence to different treatment components on weight loss. Objective: This secondary analysis of the SCALE IBT trial assessed adherence to the medication regimen, dietary self-monitoring, and physical activity recommendations and their relative contributions to weight change in individuals with obesity who were provided with IBT combined with either liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo. Methods: SCALE IBT was a double-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing 56-week weight losses in individuals with obesity who received liraglutide 3.0 mg (n = 142) or placebo (n = 140), as an adjunct to IBT. Adherence to dietary self-monitoring, physical activity, and medication usage (liraglutide or placebo) were measured during the 56-week treatment period. A regression model was used to estimate the relative contribution of adherence to each treatment component to weight loss at week 56. Results: The proportion of individuals who adhered to each intervention component decreased over time. Compared with non-adherence, complete adherence to dietary self-monitoring and physical activity recommendations were associated with estimated weight changes of -7.2% (95% CI -10.4 to -4.0; p < 0.0001) and -2.0% (95% CI -3.2 to -0.8; p = 0.0009), respectively. Complete adherence to liraglutide predicted an additional weight loss of -6.5% (95% CI -10.2 to -2.9; p = 0.0005) relative to individuals who did not adhere to the medication regimen, while adherence to placebo did not have a statistically significant effect on weight loss (p = 0.33). Conclusions: High adherence to dietary self-monitoring and use of liraglutide 3.0 mg was associated with clinically relevant weight loss with IBT and adjunctive pharmacotherapy. The effect of adherence to physical activity was significant but smaller. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.

It is strongly influenced by environmental and epigenetic factors. The principal goal of all therapeutic approaches to individuals with reproductive abnormalities is the treatment of subfertility or the regulation of menstruation when pregnancy is not desired. Obesity is closely related to insulin resistance (IR) and subsequent hyperinsulinemia, which aggravate hyperandrogenism and impair early follicle development. Weight loss is of vital importance for overweight/obese individuals with anovulatory infertility. The GLP-1R agonists have achieved remarkable weight reduction and abdominal fat loss in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as in overweight/obese individuals and individuals with prediabetes. They have also been shown to promote lower fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance markers. These beneficial effects have been suggested to be particularly helpful in women with PCOS, while their possible role in the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis is under intense research. This review analyzes the current evidence for GLP-1R agonists, focusing on their effects on ovarian morphology, menstrual dysfunction and fertility outcomes. It also discusses their future role in achieving targeted therapeutic approaches.

METHODS In a randomized, head-to-head, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled adults with obesity (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 32 to 43) who did not have diabetes. After an 8-week low-calorie diet, participants were randomly assigned for 1 year to one of four strategies: a moderate-to-vigorous–intensity exercise program plus placebo (exercise group); treatment with liraglutide (3.0 mg per day) plus usual activity (liraglutide group); exercise program plus liraglutide therapy (combination group); or placebo plus usual activity (placebo group). End points with prespecified hypotheses were the change in body weight (primary end point) and the change in body-fat percentage (secondary end point) from randomization to the end of the treatment period in the intention-to-treat population. Prespecified metabolic health-related end points and safety were also assessed. RESULTS After the 8-week low-calorie diet, 195 participants had a mean decrease in body weight of 13.1 kg. At 1 year, all the active-treatment strategies led to greater weight loss than placebo: difference in the exercise group, −4.1 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], −7.8 to −0.4; P=0.03); in the liraglutide group, −6.8 kg (95% CI, −10.4 to −3.1; P<0.001); and in the combination group, −9.5 kg (95% CI, −13.1 to −5.9; P<0.001). The combination strategy led to greater weight loss than exercise (difference, −5.4 kg; 95% CI, −9.0 to −1.7; P=0.004) but not liraglutide (−2.7 kg; 95% CI, −6.3 to 0.8; P=0.13). The combination strategy decreased body-fat percentage by 3.9 percentage points, which was approximately twice the decrease in the exercise group (−1.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −3.2 to −0.2; P=0.02) and the liraglutide group (−1.9 percentage points; 95% CI, −3.3 to −0.5; P=0.009). Only the combination strategy was associated with improvements in the glycated hemoglobin level, insulin sensitivity, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Increased heart rate and cholelithiasis were observed more often in the liraglutide group than in the combination group. CONCLUSIONS A strategy combining exercise and liraglutide therapy improved healthy weight loss maintenance more than either treatment alone.

Methods: All literature from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and Clinical Trials was searched, and the language was limited to English. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, continuous data extraction, and independent assessment of bias risk. Our primary outcomes were alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and triglyceride levels, while our secondary outcomes were high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, body weight, BMI, and fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Results: The review identified 20 eligible trials that met the inclusion criteria. We found that, compared to other drugs, thiazolidinediones, especially pioglitazone, had a greater effect on the levels of ALT (-8.01 (95% CI -14.3 to 2.02)) and AST (-5.0 (95% CI -9.21 to -1,22)) and other biological indicators, but they were also associated with an increased risk of weight gain (3.62 (95% CI 2.25 to 4.99) and increased BMI (0.59 (95% Cl -0.13 to 1.29). GLP1 RAs and metformin also had better therapeutic effects than other drugs as measured by the levels of ALT (liraglutide: -9.36 (95% Cl -18 to -0.34), metformin: -2.84 (95% CI -11.09 to 5.28)) and AST (liraglutide: -5.14 (95% CI -10.69 to 0.37), metformin: -2.39 (95% CI -7.55, 2.49)) and other biological indicators. Conclusion: Despite the significant risk of weight gain, thiazolidinediones, especially pioglitazone, are beneficial in normalizing liver and glucose metabolism in NAFLD patients. In clinical practice, we believe that GLP1 RAs such as liraglutide and exenatide or metformin can be used in combination to offset the risk of weight gain associated with thiazolidinediones. However, long-term studies are still needed to verify the efficacy and safety of individual hypoglycemic agents.

Bariatric surgery, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), has been shown to improve metabolic and histologic markers of NAFLD. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues lead to improvements in phase 2 clinical trials. We directly compared the effects of RYGB with a treatment using liraglutide and/or peptide tyrosine tyrosine 3-36 (PYY3-36) in a rat model for early NAFLD. Methods: Obese male Wistar rats (high-fat diet (HFD)-induced) were randomized into the following treatment groups: RYGB, sham-operation (sham), liraglutide (0.4 mg/kg/day), PYY3-36 (0.1 mg/kg/day), liraglutide+PYY3-36, and saline. After an observation period of 4 weeks, liver samples were histologically evaluated, ELISAs and RNA sequencing + RT-qPCRs were performed. Results: RYGB and liraglutide+PYY3-36 induced a similar body weight loss and, compared to sham/saline, marked histological improvements with significantly less steatosis. However, only RYGB induced significant metabolic improvements (e.g., adiponectin/leptin ratio 18.8 ± 11.8 vs. 2.4 ± 1.2 in liraglutide+PYY3-36-or 1.4 ± 0.9 in sham-treated rats). Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed a high number of differentially regulated genes in RYGB treated animals only. Conclusions: The combination therapy of liraglutide+PYY3-36 partly mimics the positive effects of RYGB on weight reduction and on hepatic steatosis, while its effects on metabolic function lack behind RYGB. © 2022 by the authors.

To explore the application value of medical intelligent electronic system under the background of Internet of Things in the clinical study of the treatment of overweight/obesity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with empagliflozin combined with liraglutide; 50 overweight and obese adult T2DM patients in our hospital were randomly divided into the combined group and the control group, 25 cases in each group. The control group was treated with liraglutide alone, while the combined group was treated with empagliflozin on the basis of liraglutide. Based on the Internet of Things technology, with diabetes management as the core, the functions of information collection, transmission, and storage of T2DM patients are realized. Doctors pass the diabetes management plan to T2DM patients through the platform, supervise the implementation, and finally compare the clinical efficacy of the two groups. Results. Compared with before treatment, the body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FPG), postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), islet beta cell secretion function index (HOMA-β), islet resistance index (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) in both groups decreased significantly after treatment. After combined treatment, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), FPG, 2hPG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR in the combined group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). Hypoglycemia occurred in both groups, with 2 cases in the control group and 4 cases in the combined group. Conclusion. The telemedicine management system based on Internet of Things technology can improve patients' self-management ability and provide a new choice for individualized treatment of overweight/obesity T2DM patients. The combination therapy of empagliflozin and liraglutide can effectively reduce blood sugar, weight, blood pressure, blood lipid, and hypoglycemia and effectively improve insulin resistance and secretion function of islet β cells in T2DM patients. © 2022 Kaisang Lin et al.","","Adult; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Internet of Things; Liraglutide; Obesity; Overweight; Technology; Telemedicine; Treatment Outcome; Blood; Glucose; Information management; Insulin; Internet of things; Patient treatment; Telemedicine; liraglutide; Blood glucose; Clinical efficacy; Control groups; Diabetes management; Internet of things technologies; Liraglutide; Management systems; Resistance index; Secretion function; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; adult; complication; controlled study; glucose blood level; human; hypoglycemia; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; randomized controlled trial; technology; telemedicine; treatment outcome; Blood pressure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133252153"

Objectives: We evaluated counterregulatory responses during postprandial hypoglycemia in individuals with PBH who underwent RYGB. Setting: University hospital. Methods: Eleven women with documented PBH who had RYGB underwent a baseline liquid mixed meal test (MMT) followed by 5 MMTs preceded by treatment with (1) acarbose 50 mg, (2) sitagliptin 100 mg, (3) verapamil 120 mg, (4) liraglutide 1.2 mg, and (5) pasireotide 300 μg. Blood was collected at fixed time intervals. Plasma and serum were analyzed for glucose, insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and cortisol. Results: During the baseline MMT, participants had nadir blood glucose concentrations of 3.3 ±.2 mmol/L. At the time of nadir glucose, there was a small but significant increase in plasma glucagon. Plasma epinephrine concentrations were not increased at nadir glucose but were significantly elevated by the end of the MMT. There were no changes in norepinephrine, PP, and cortisol concentrations in response to hypoglycemia. After treatment with sitagliptin, 8 individuals had glucose nadirs <3.2 mmol/L (versus 4 individuals at baseline), and significant increases in glucagon, PP, and cortisol responses were observed. Conclusions: In response to postprandial hypoglycemia, individuals with PBH who underwent RYGB only had minor increases in counterregulatory hormones, while larger hormone responses occurred when glucose levels were lowered during treatment with sitagliptin. The glycemic threshold for counterregulatory activation could be altered in individuals with PBH, possibly explained by recurrent hypoglycemia. © 2020 American Society for Bariatric Surgery","Counterregulation; Gastric bypass; Postbariatric hypoglycemia","Blood Glucose; Female; Gastric Bypass; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Insulin; Obesity, Morbid; acarbose; epinephrine; glucagon; glucose; hydrocortisone; insulin; liraglutide; noradrenalin; pancreas polypeptide; pasireotide; potassium; sitagliptin; verapamil; insulin; adrenalin blood level; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical trial; drug dose titration; female; glucagon blood level; glucose blood level; heart rate; hormone response; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hyperinsulinemia; hypoglycemia; insulin blood level; interstitial fluid; noradrenalin blood level; pancreas polypeptide blood level; postbariatric hypoglycemia; postprandial state; potassium blood level; priority journal; protein blood level; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; single drug dose; test meal; unconsciousness; adverse event; gastric bypass surgery; hypoglycemia; morbid obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092220471"

The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the microbial, metabolomic, and inflammatory changes that occur following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). A prospective clinical trial was conducted with participants undergoing RYGB, SG, and non-operative controls (CTRL). Clinical parameters, blood samples, and fecal samples were collected pre-intervention and at 3 and 9 months. A multi-omics approach was used to perform integrated microbial-metabolomic analysis to identify functional pathways in which weight loss and metabolic changes occur after surgery. RYGB led to profound microbial changes over time that included reductions in alpha-diversity, increased Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobiota, decreased Firmicutes, and numerous changes at the genera level. These changes were associated with a reduction in inflammation and significant weight loss. A reduction in Romboutsia genera correlated strongly with weight loss and integrated microbial-metabolomic analysis revealed the importance of Romboutsia. Its obliteration correlated with improved weight loss and insulin resistance, possibly through decreases in glycerophospholipids. In contrast, SG was associated with no changes in alpha-diversity, and only a small number of changes in microbial genera. A cluster of Firmicutes genera including Butyriciccocus, Eubacterium ventriosum, and Monoglobus was decreased, which correlated with decreased weight, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. This work represents comprehensive analyses of microbial-metabolomic changes that occur following bariatric surgery and identifies several pathways that are associated with beneficial metabolic effects of surgery. © 2022 The Author(s).

Whether clinically important responses and adverse events (AEs) are dependent on the route of administration has not been determined. We demonstrate that nearly identical exposure-response pharmacodynamic relationships are determined by plasma semaglutide levels achieved through oral versus injectable administration for changes in HbA1c, body weight, biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, and AEs such as nausea and vomiting. At typical exposure levels for oral semaglutide, the estimated response is 1.58% (oral) versus −1.62% (subcutaneous) for HbA1c and 3.77% (oral) versus 3.48% (subcutaneous) reduction in body weight relative to baseline after 6 months. Increased body weight is the most important variable associated with reduced semaglutide exposure for both formulations.

Pharmacologic therapies are approved for the treatment of obesity; however, short-term biomarkers to predict weight loss are not well understood. This study aimed to determine the ability of single-meal energy intake (EI) to predict weight loss in participants with obesity treated with liraglutide. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, participants received subcutaneous liraglutide (titrated to 3.0 mg/day) or placebo once daily, with inpatient assessments at baseline and weeks 3 and 6. The primary endpoint was change from baseline (CFB) in EI during consecutive ad libitum lunch meals at weeks 3 and 6. Secondary endpoints included CFB in 24- and 48-h EI, weight, appetite scores, and gastric emptying measures. Results: Sixty-one participants were randomized (n = 32, liraglutide; n = 29, placebo). The least squares mean (LSM) difference (95% CI; p-value) in CFB in EI during ad libitum lunch meals between the liraglutide and placebo groups was −236 (−322, −149; p < 0.0001) kcal at week 3 and –244 (−339, −148, p < 0.0001) kcal at week 6. The liraglutide group experienced significant weight loss at weeks 3 and 6, compared with placebo. Weight loss was significantly correlated with EI, but not with appetite score or gastric emptying. Conclusions: EI during a single meal is a robust clinical predictor of weight changes in participants with obesity. Future clinical trials can utilize EI at a single meal as a predictor of weight loss. © 2021 The Authors.

In contrast, weight loss in ES was 1.0 ± 0.9 kg/m2 (i.e., 20% of regained weight). Thirty-seven percent of FP experienced serious complications (p < 0.05) in contrast to the other groups. An improved prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia was observed in LG and FP (p < 0.02) 24 months after intervention. Conclusions: Weight regain during more than 6 years after RYGB can be safely and effectively reversed with liraglutide. Compared with revisional surgery, pharmacotherapy with liraglutide was low risk and resulted in an important improvement in hypertension and dyslipidemia. Therefore, daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide are a valid option to treat weight regain after RYGB. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bariatric surgery; Endosurgery; Liraglutide; Revisional surgery; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; Weight regain","Body Mass Index; Female; Gastric Bypass; Humans; Liraglutide; Male; Obesity, Morbid; Prospective Studies; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Weight Gain; analgesic agent; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; proton pump inhibitor; liraglutide; adult; Article; body mass; body weight gain; body weight loss; comorbidity; comparative effectiveness; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; device removal; drug dose increase; dyslipidemia; endoscopic surgery; feeding behavior; female; follow up; gastrointestinal symptom; gastrojejunostomy; gastroscopy; human; hypertension; implantation; internal hernia; laparoscopic pouch resizing; laparoscopic surgery; laparotomy; lifestyle modification; liquid diet; major clinical study; male; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutritional counseling; obesity; patient counseling; penetrating trauma; physical activity; postoperative complication; priority journal; prospective study; recurrent disease; reoperation; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; stomach pouch; substance use; suture technique; upper abdominal pain; body weight gain; gastric bypass surgery; morbid obesity; reoperation; retrospective study; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088285713"

Objective: We evaluated effectiveness of dulaglutide in routine clinical practice, especially in subgroups of patient that are underrepresented in RCTs. Design: Retrospective multicenter study. Setting: Diabetes outpatient clinics. Patients and intervention: All consecutive patients who initiated dulaglutide between 2015 and 2018. Main outcome measures: Changes in HbA1c and body weight were assessed up to 30 months after baseline. Effectiveness was analyzed in patient subgroups according to: prior use of GLP- 1RA, persistence on treatment and dose, age, sex, disease duration, renal function, obesity, cardiovascular disease, or concomitant use of insulin or sulphonylurea. Results: From a background population of 83,116 patients, 2084 initiated dulaglutide (15.3% switching from another GLP-1RA), 1307 of whom had at least 1 follow-up visit. Overall, dulaglutide reduced HbA1c by 1.0% and body weight by 2.9 kg at the end of observation. These effects were more pronounced in GLP-1RA-naïve patients and in those with shorter disease duration. Improvement in HbA1c was highly significant and consistent across all subgroups, including those aged = 75 years, nonobese, or with chronic kidney disease. Body weight declined in all subgroups and significantly more with the 1.5-mg versus 0.75-mg dose. Conclusions: In real-world T2D patients, effectiveness of dulaglutide on HbA1c and body weight reduction was highly consistent and significant even in subgroups of patients poorly represented in RCTs. © 2020 Endocrine Society.

Methods: We performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis (NMA) utilizing the following data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Central and clinical trial registries, from inception to March 2, 2021. The prespecified criteria for study inclusion were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of ≥12 weeks’ duration. The data appraisal and extraction were performed by two investigators independently, using the published reports. The main outcomes and statistical methods were weight loss over placebo (WLOP) and adverse events (AEs) among GLP-1 agents using random-effects NMA (frequentist approach); relative ranking using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) method and certainty of evidence using grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE). Findings: 64 RCTs (from 2004 to 2021) included 27018 patients (median of age, 55.1 years old; 57.4% women; baseline weight 94.8kg and BMI 33.0kg/m2; trial duration 26 weeks). Direct meta-analysis showed significant WLOP with: -1.44kg (95% CI, -2.14 to -0.74) with dulaglutide ≥1.5 mg; -1.82kg (-2.42 to -1.23) with exenatide immediate release (IR); -2.20kg (-4.31 to -0.08) with exenatide extended release (ER); -3.20kg (-6.53 to 0.15) with efpeglenatide; -2.72kg (-3.35 to -2.09) with liraglutide ≤1.8mg; -4.49kg (-5.26 to -3.72) with liraglutide >1.8mg; -0.62kg (-1.22 to -0.02) with lixisenatide; -4.33kg (-5.71 to -3.00) with semaglutide SQ <2.4mg; -9.88kg (-13.17 to -6.59) with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg; -2.73kg (-4.81 to -0.65) with semaglutide oral; and -1.71kg (-2.64 to -0.78) with taspoglutide.

Currently available anti-obesity drugs acting in the gastrointestinal tract, or the central nervous system have shown limited efficacy in the reduction of obesity, accompanied by severe side effects. Therefore, a novel therapeutic delivery targeting adipocytes and normalizing excess fat transport and accumulation is necessary to maximize efficacy and reduce side effects for long-term treatment. Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is an adipokine that coordinates lipid transport in mature adipocyte and its inhibition in obesity model showed weight loss and normalized insulin response. Reduction of FABP4 level in adipocytes was compensated by fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5), which resulted in reduction of recovery of obesity and co-morbidities related to obesity by FABP4 knock-down alone. In this study, we developed a non-viral gene delivery system, sh (FABP4/5)/ATS9R, that silences FABP4 and FABP5 simultaneously with oligopeptide (ATS9R) that can selectively target mature adipocyte. For future clinical application to increase patient compliance, sh (FABP4/5)/ATS9R was administered subcutaneously and intraperitoneally to obese animal model and both routes demonstrated startling dual gene efficacy in visceral adipose tissues. Furthermore, dual gene silencing efficiently alleviated obesity, improved insulin sensitivity and restored hepatic metabolism in high fat diet-induced type 2 diabetes mouse model. Targeted-dual gene silencing of sh (FABP4/5)/ATS9R in adipose tissues demonstrated synergistic effects to overcome obesity and obesity-induced metabolic diseases and beneficial effects against liraglutide, providing a great potential for future translational research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-Obesity; Dual gene silencing; Insulin sensitivity; Synergistic effect","Adipocytes, White; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins; Gene Silencing; Insulin Resistance; Mice; Obesity; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Drug interactions; Fatty acids; Gene therapy; Gene transfer; Histology; Insulin; Metabolism; Molecular weight; Nutrition; Targeted drug delivery; Tissue; fatty acid binding protein; fatty acid binding protein 4; fatty acid binding protein 5; liraglutide; oligopeptide; unclassified drug; Fabp4 protein, mouse; fatty acid binding protein; % reductions; Adipocytes; Anti-obesity; Dual gene silencing; Fatty acid-binding proteins; Gene silencing; Insulin sensitivity; Metabolic disease; Side effect; Synergistic effect; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antiobesity activity; Article; body weight loss; cell differentiation; controlled study; FABP4 gene; FABP5 gene; flow cytometry; gene; gene silencing; gene targeting; glucose tolerance test; immunohistochemistry; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin tolerance test; intra-abdominal fat; liver metabolism; male; mouse; MTT assay; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nonviral gene delivery system; randomized controlled trial; Western blotting; white adipocyte; animal; gene silencing; genetics; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; white adipocyte; Proteins","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117732350"

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of combining AOMs with a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, employer-based weight management program (WMP) compared with the WMP alone on weight loss, treatment adherence, and work productivity and limitations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 1-year, single-center, open-label, parallel-group, real-world, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic s Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, from January 7, 2019, to May 22, 2020. Participants were adults with obesity (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] 30) enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic Employee Health Plan. INTERVENTIONS In total, 200 participants were randomized 1:1, 100 participants to WMP combined with an AOM (WMP+Rx), and 100 participants to WMP alone. The WMP was the Cleveland Clinic Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute s employer-based integrated medical WMP implemented through monthly multidisciplinary shared medical appointments. Participants in the WMP+Rx group initiated treatment with 1 of 5 US Food and Drug Administration approved medications for chronic weight management (orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide, 3.0mg) according to standard clinical practice. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the percentage change in body weight from baseline to month 12. RESULTS The 200 participants were predominately (177 of 200 [88.5%]) women, had a mean (SD) age of 50.0 (10.3) years, and a mean (SD) baseline weight of 105.0 (19.0) kg. For the primary intention-To-Treat estimand, the estimated mean (SE) weight loss was ?7.7%(0.7%) for the WMP+Rx group vs ?4.2%(0.7%) for the WMP group, with an estimated treatment difference of ?3.5%(95% CI, ?5.5%to ?1.5%) (P > .001). The estimated percentage of participants achieving at least 5%weight loss was 62.5%for WMP+Rx vs 44.8%for WMP (P = .02). The rate of attendance at shared medical appointmentswas higher for theWMP+Rx group than for theWMPgroup. No meaningful differences in patient-reported work productivity or limitation measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinically meaningful superior mean weight loss was achieved when access to AOMs was provided in the real-world setting of an employer-based WMP, compared with theWMPalone. Such results may inform employer decisions regarding AOMcoverage and guide best practices for comprehensive, interdisciplinary employer-based WMPs. © 2021 American Medical Association.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of DPP-4i on leptin concentrations in subjects with T2DM. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with comparators were systematically searched through PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Quantitative analysis was performed with a fixed or random-effects model according to heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by using the standard methods for sensitivity analysis. Results: Ten trials with 698 patients with T2DM were included. Pooled analysis demonstrated that DPP-4i did not significantly change leptin concentrations (1.31 ng/mL, 95 % CI − 0.48 to 3.10). DPP-4i exerted effects on modulating leptin levels compared to active comparators (0.21 ng/mL, 95 % CI − 1.37 to 1.78). Meta-analysis was powerful and stable after sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: DPP-4i did not modulate leptin concentrations in T2DM and exerted no stronger effects than traditional antidiabetic agents. © 2021, The Author(s).","Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; Leptin; Randomized controlled trials; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","alogliptin; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glimepiride; leptin; linagliptin; liraglutide; metformin; mitiglinide; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; traditional antidiabetic agent; unclassified drug; vildagliptin; voglibose; adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; female; human; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; outcome assessment; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); sensitivity analysis; systematic review","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113460717"

Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) improves multiple health outcomes in adults with T2D. Initial small, uncontrolled studies of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass have also suggested beneficial effects in adolescents. Definitive studies in youth with T2D are lacking, especially with the now more common form of MBS, vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). The surgical or medical treatment for paediatric type 2 diabetes (ST 2 OMP) clinical trial was designed to test the hypothesis that VSG will more effectively reduce hyperglycaemic and diabetes comorbidities than the best currently available medical treatment incorporating state of the art pharmacotherapies. ST 2 OMP is also designed to better understand the pancreatic and enterohepatic mechanisms by which MBS improves diabetes and its associated comorbidities. Methods and analysis ST 2 OMP is a prospective, open-label, controlled clinical trial that will recruit 90 postpubertal participants, age range 13-19.9 years, with body mass index ≥35 kg/m 2 or >120% of 95th percentile and youth-onset T2D. The primary outcome is the per cent of youth achieving haemoglobin A1c <6.0% at 12 months postgroup allocation (post-VSG vs postmedical group allocation). Secondary outcomes include remission of comorbidities and measures of β-cell and incretin responses at 12 and 24 months post VSG versus AMT. Ethics and dissemination The ST 2 OMP protocol was approved by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Colorado Institutional Review Boards.

Methods: People first using liraglutide starting in 2018 were recruited from ten sites in Korea. Body weight and body mass index (BMI) were measured after 2, 4, and 6 months and compared with baseline values. Results: The full cohort comprised 769 participants: 672 in the 2-month group, 427 in the 4-month group, and 219 in the 6-month group. The baseline mean ± standard deviation of BMI and body weight were 32.2 ± 5.1 kg/m2, and 87.5 ± 18.8 kg, respectively. Body weight and BMI decreased after initiation of liraglutide treatment: −2.94 kg and −1.08 kg/m2 at 2 months; −4.23 kg and −1.55 kg/m2 at 4 months, and −5.14 kg and −1.89 kg/m2 at 6 months (all P < 0.001). In the 6-month cohort, 52.5% and 18.3% of subjects lost ≥5% and ≥10% of body weight, respectively. After 6 months, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly by 3.90 and 1.93 mmHg, respectively. In those with diabetes mellitus, HbA1c and fasting glucose levels decreased significantly by 1.14% and 27.8 mg/dl, respectively. Among all participants, 27.6% experienced adverse effects, including nausea (20.8%), vomiting (5.2%), diarrhoea (2.5%), and skin rash (3.6%). Documented reasons for discontinuation of treatment were lack of effect (4.4%), adverse events (4.3%), and high cost (3.1%). Conclusions: In real-world settings in Korea, daily treatment with liraglutide 3 mg was associated with clinically meaningful weight loss without serious adverse events. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Adult; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Exercise; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Life Style; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Republic of Korea; Weight Loss; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea; liraglutide; adult; Article; blood pressure regulation; body mass; body weight; body weight loss; cardiometabolic risk; cohort analysis; constipation; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; diastolic blood pressure; diet therapy; dizziness; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; exercise; female; gastrointestinal symptom; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypoglycemia; insulin treatment; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; nausea; obesity; observational study; priority journal; rash; retrospective study; South Korea; systolic blood pressure; treatment duration; vomiting; waist circumference; weakness; blood pressure; body weight loss; clinical trial; exercise; lifestyle; middle aged; multicenter study; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099551787"

We aimed to evaluate the effects of injectable liraglutide 3·0 mg daily on body fat distribution in adults with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular disease risk. Methods: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4, single centre trial, we enrolled community-dwelling adults, recruited from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, with BMI of at least 30 kg/m2 or BMI of at least 27 kg/m2 with metabolic syndrome but without diabetes and randomly assigned them, in a 1:1 ratio, to 40 weeks of treatment with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3·0 mg or placebo, in addition to a 500 kcal deficient diet and guideline-recommended physical activity counselling. The primary endpoint was percentage reduction in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) measured with MRI. All randomly assigned participants with a follow-up imaging assessment were included in efficacy analyses and all participants who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03038620. Findings: Between July 20, 2017 and Feb 21, 2020 from 235 participants assessed for eligibility, 185 participants were randomly assigned (n=92 liraglutide, n=93 placebo) and 128 (n=73 liraglutide, n=55 placebo) were included in the final analysis (92% female participants, 37% Black participants, 24% Hispanic participants, mean age 50·2 years (SD 9·4), mean BMI 37·7 kg/m2). Mean change in VAT over median 36·2 weeks was −12·49% (SD 9·3%) with liraglutide compared with −1·63% (SD 12·3%) with placebo, estimated treatment difference −10·86% (95% CI −6·97 to −14·75, p<0·0001). Effects seemed consistent across subgroups of age, sex, race–ethnicity, BMI, and baseline prediabetes. The most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related (43 [47%] of 92 with liraglutide and 12 [13%] of 93 with placebo) and upper respiratory tract infections (10 [11%] of 92 with liraglutide and 14 [15%] of 93 with placebo). Interpretation: In adults with overweight or obesity at high cardiovascular disease risk, once-daily liraglutide 3·0 mg plus lifestyle intervention significantly lowered visceral adipose tissue over 40 weeks of treatment. Visceral fat reduction may be one mechanism to explain the benefits seen on cardiovascular outcomes in previous trials with liraglutide among patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods: We performed an open-label study in 14 obese men (age 38 ± 11 years, body mass index 32 ± 4 kg/m2) without diabetes. Subjects were examined at baseline, during titration (week 4) of liraglutide towards 3.0 mg/day, and 2 weeks after steady-state treatment (week 6) of a final dose of liraglutide. The primary endpoint was pancreatic volume determined by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary endpoints included pancreatic oedema and cellularity, positron emission tomography-based [18F]fluorothymidine (FLT) uptake (DNA synthesis) and plasma pancreatic enzymes. Results: Plasma amylase (+7 U/L [95% confidence intervals 3-11], P <.01) and lipase (+19 U/L [7-30], P <.01) increased during liraglutide treatment. Pancreatic volume did not change from baseline to steady state of treatment (+0.2 cm3 [−8-8], P =.96) and no change in pancreatic cellular infiltration was found (P =.22).

Modifiable risk factors including cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes, poor diet quality, obesity, and physical inactivity, along with underlying genetic factors contribute to lower extremity atherosclerosis. Patients with PAD often have coexistent coronary or cerebrovascular disease, and increased likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Patients with PAD often have reduced walking capacity and are at risk of acute and chronic critical limb ischemia leading to major adverse limb events, such as peripheral revascularization or amputation. The presence of polyvascular disease identifies the highest risk patient group for major adverse cardiovascular events, and patients with prior critical limb ischemia, prior lower extremity revascularization, or amputation have a heightened risk of major adverse limb events. Medical therapies have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events, and improving function in patients with PAD by modulating key disease determining pathways including inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. Treatment with guideline-recommended therapies, including smoking cessation, lipid lowering drugs, optimal glucose control, and antithrombotic medications lowers the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events. Exercise training and cilostazol improve walking capacity. The heterogeneity of risk profile in patients with PAD supports a personalized approach, with consideration of treatment intensification in those at high risk of adverse events. This review highlights the medical therapies currently available to improve outcomes in patients with PAD. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

More and more attention has been paid to the efficacy of liraglutide in the treatment of NAFLD, but the clinical evidence is still insufficient. Objective: The purpose of this study was to use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) assessment of metformin alone poor blood glucose control of obese patients type 2 diabetes with NAFLD, added with insulin glargine, liraglutide or placebo effect in improving the fatty liver. Methods: This is a 26-week, single-center, prospective, randomized placebo-controlled study. From September 2016 to July 2018, 128 patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD were enrolled in the China joint logistics team 900 hospital. The primary endpoints were the changes in intrahepatic content of lipid (IHCL), abdominal adiposity [subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)], from baseline to week 26 (end of treatment) and the changes in liraglutide group or insulin glargine group versus change in placebo group. Secondary endpoints included the changes in liver function (AST and ALT), glycemia (HbA1c and FPG), body weight, and BMI. Results: A total of 96 patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD under inadequate glycemic control by metformin were randomized (1:1:1) to receive add-on insulin glargine, liraglutide, or placebo. After 26 weeks of treatment, compared to the placebo group, in the liraglutide and insulin glargine groups, IHCL significantly decreased from baseline to week 26 (liraglutide 26.4% ± 3.2% to 20.6% ± 3.9%, P < 0.05; insulin glargine 25.0% ± 4.3% to 22.6% ± 5.8%, P > 0.05). SAT and VAT decreased significantly in the liraglutide group and in the insulin glargine group (P < 0.05). ΔSAT and ΔVAT were greater with liraglutide than insulin glargine, they were significantly different between the two groups (ΔSAT, −36 vs. − 24.5, P < 0.05; and ΔVAT, −47 vs. − 16.6, P > 0.05). In the liraglutide group, AST, ALT, and HOMA-IR decreased significantly from baseline. There was no significant difference in glucose-lowering among the three groups. During the treatment, the safety of the three groups performed well. Conclusion: Compared with placebo, treatment with liraglutide plus an adequate dose of metformin (2000 g/ day) for 26 weeks is more effective in reducing IHCL, SAT and VAT in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. And it has additional advantages in weight loss, waist circumference reduction and liver function improvement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Insulin glargine; Intrahepatic content of lipid; Liraglutide; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; Type 2 diabetes","Adult; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; China; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Glargine; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Liraglutide; Liver; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Obesity; Prospective Studies; Subcutaneous Fat; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin glargine; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; antidiabetic agent; glycosylated hemoglobin; insulin glargine; liraglutide; metformin; abdominal distension; abdominal obesity; add on therapy; adult; Article; bedtime dosage; body mass; body weight; China; controlled study; diarrhea; disease association; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; human tissue; hypoglycemia; intra-abdominal fat; major clinical study; male; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; population research; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rash; subcutaneous fat; blood; body weight loss; combination drug therapy; drug effect; liver; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092737613"

This retrospective study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of L therapy in a real-life setting. Methods: 93 consecutive non-diabetic OO, referring to a single Obesity Center, started L therapy from October 2016 to December 2018: 21/93 OO discontinued the treatment within 90 days for various reasons. 72/93 OO (55 females, 17 males), mean ± SD age 49 ± 12.5 years (18–78) and mean body mass index 39.1 ± 5.8 (28.3–55.3) were included for further analysis. 60/72 OO reached the final dose of 3.0 mg/day. Results: Mean weight loss was 7.1% in the OO who reached the dose of 3.0 mg; 68.3%, 20.0% and 10.0% of OO lost ≥ 5%, 10% and 15% of body weight, respectively. A linear correlation between early and final weight loss was found. Moreover, we observed a significant reduction of mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a significant increase of mean heart rate. The overall incidence of side effects was 18.3% (17/93). Conclusion: L treatment of OO in a real life setting yielded results comparable to those reported by the major RCCTs. Combining the results of RCCTs with the observations from real life may increase their power and overcome their respective limitations. © 2020, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).","Liraglutide; Obesity; Obesity therapy; Real life experience; Weight loss","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blood Pressure; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Italy; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; Young Adult; liraglutide; liraglutide; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; body mass; body weight loss; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; diarrhea; diastolic blood pressure; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; heart rate; human; injection site reaction; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nausea; obesity; outcome assessment; patient compliance; personal experience; retrospective study; skin manifestation; systolic blood pressure; tachycardia; treatment planning; trend study; vomiting; adolescent; aged; blood pressure; body weight loss; drug effect; Italy; obesity; pathophysiology; treatment outcome; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087292280"

Materials and methods: The individual longitudinal body weight data from the main trial periods of three phase II/III trials in overweight or obese patients (56-week treatment with once-daily liraglutide 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0 mg or placebo, n = 4952) were analysed using a non-linear mixed-effect modelling approach. Individual pharmacokinetic profiles were derived based on published pharmacokinetic models. Baseline body weight, baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), age, gender, diabetes status (no diabetes, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes), race and trial region were investigated as covariates. As a form of external validation, the model was used to predict the weight regain after treatment cessation at week 56 (data not included in model development). Results: A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model provided an adequate description of the weight loss trajectories for all studied doses. Gender and diabetes status were identified as the most influential covariates, and an underlying seasonal weight fluctuation was identified. Slower than that recommended, one-week dose-escalation algorithms led up to 2 weeks slower initial weight loss but similar long-term weight loss trajectories. Conclusions: The relationship between liraglutide systemic exposure and weight loss was successfully established in overweight or obese people. The model could predict the time course of weight regain after treatment cessation and suggests that GI tolerability can be mitigated by slower escalation with only minor impact on the weight loss trajectory. © 2020 The Authors.

To evaluate the contemporary landscape in which these recommendations would be implemented, we examined the use of these medications according to clinical guideline practice. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2017 to 2018, we defined compelling indications for SGLT-2 inhibitors by the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, and for GLP-1RAs by the presence of established or high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, based on large clinical trials that have been incorporated in guideline recommendations of the American College of Cardiology and American Diabetes Association. We then evaluated use of these medications among patients with physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. All analyses incorporated complex survey design to produce nationally representative estimates. A total 1104 of 9254 sampled individuals had type 2 diabetes mellitus, representing 10.6% (95% CI, 9.7%-11.6%) of the US population or 33.2 million adults nationally. Of these, 52.6% (95% CI, 47.7%-57.5%) had an indication for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 32.8% (95% CI, 28.8%-37.2%) for GLP-1RAs, and 26.6% (95% CI, 22.2%-31.7%) for both medications. During 2017 to 2018, 4.5% (95% CI, 2.4%-8.2%) were treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors and 1.5% (95% CI, 0.7%-3.2%) with GLP-1RAs. Atherosclerotic cardiovas-cular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease were not independently associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA use in patients with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a large number of patients being eligible for guideline-recommended cardiorenal protective therapies, there are substantial gaps in the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, limiting their public health benefits. © 2021 The Authors.

The objective of the study was to examine the incidence of GUI in patients aged 65 years or older initiated on SGLT2i compared with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) therapy at a large academic health system. Methods: A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using electronic health records of patients aged 65 years and older with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients newly initiated on SGLT2i or GLP1-RA therapy with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ⩾30 mL/min per 1.73 m² and active within the health system for at least 1 year prior to initiation were included. We compared the incidence of inpatient, emergency room, or outpatient diagnosis of GUI (bacterial and mycotic) within 6 months of SGLT2i or GLP1-RA initiation. A chi-square or Fisher’s exact test were used to analyze between-group differences for categorical variables, while a t-test was used for continuous variables. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the impact of confounding variables on the primary outcome. Results: One hundred and thirty-three patients were initiated on SGLT2i therapy and 341 patients newly initiated on GLP1-RA therapy. After adjusting for differences in age, A1c, body mass index, eGFR, race and sex, there was no statistically significant difference in GUI incidence within 6 months of SGLT2i versus GLP1-RA initiation (3.8% versus 6.5%, adjusted hazard ratio: 0.784, 95% confidence interval 0.260–2.367). Conclusion: We found no increased risk of composite GUI within 6 months of initiating SGLT2i compared with GLP1-RA therapy. These real-world data in older adults add to previous findings, which suggest no increased risk of urinary tract infection with SGLT2i initiation. Plain language summary: A class of antidiabetic medications and risk for genitourinary infections in older adults with type 2 diabetes Older adults with type 2 diabetes often benefit from a class of antidiabetic medications known as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) which help to lower blood glucose, decrease risk for cardiovascular disease and prevent kidney disease progression. However, there is concern that these medications may increase risk for urinary tract infections and/or genital fungal infections in older adults based on clinical trial evidence. Our study evaluated the real-world occurrence of these safety events in patients aged 65 years or older who were newly started on these medications. We compared these patients with a group of patients newly started on an alternative class of antidiabetic agents which are not expected to increase risk for infections, known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA). In our study, we included 133 patients who started an SGLT2i and 341 patients who started a GLP1-RA at a large teaching hospital. We evaluated the occurrence of infection up to 6 months after initiation of these mediations. We found no significant difference in infection rate between these two groups. We conclude in the study that the use of SGLT2i in older adults was not associated with increased risk for urinary tract infections or genital fungal infections when compared with GLP1-RA use. © The Author(s), 2021.","cohort study; genital mycotic infection; GLP1-RA; risk of infection; urinary tract infection; yeast infection","albiglutide; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; dulaglutide; empagliflozin; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; semaglutide; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; aged; Article; bacterial infection; cohort analysis; coronary artery atherosclerosis; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; incidence; kidney function; major clinical study; male; mycosis; nephrolithiasis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; outcome assessment; prostate hypertrophy; prostatitis; retrospective study; risk factor; urinary tract infection; urinary tract obstruction; urine incontinence; urogenital tract infection; vaginitis; vulvovaginitis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103428430"

Methods: Observational, prospective, multicenter study. Patients with steatosis determined by FLI (values <30 rule out and >60 indicate steatosis) and HIS (values <30 rule out and >36 indicate steatosis) who received combination therapy were included. Patients were stratified into three groups according to the sequential order of treatment. We used robust statistical methods. Results: In our final report we included 174 patients (58.6% males), mean age 61.9 (10) years. Baseline body mass index, waist circumference and weight were 36.5 (6.8) kg/m2, 117.5 (15.1) cm and 99.4 (20.5) kg, respectively. One hundred percent of patients had altered biomarkers of fatty liver scores (FLI 96 [13] and HSI 49.2 [8.5]). At 26 weeks, significant reductions in FLI (−4.5 [95% CI 3.5–5.9] p <.001) and HSI (−2.4 [95% CI 1.6–3.2] p <.001) were found in the total sample and pre-specified treatment and FLI cut-off point subgroups. Conclusion: Our results show a beneficial effect of the combination of GLP-1RAs plus SGLT2is on liver steatosis that goes beyond glucose control, and it is related mainly to weight loss, a decline in biomarkers and reductions in abdominal circumference.

The prevalence of obesity in PCOS patients reaches up to 80%, which is 2-fold higher than the general population. Objective The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 55 pharmacological interventions across 17 different outcomes in overweight/obese PCOS patients with hyperandrogenism manifestations for both short- and long-term follow-ups. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials comparing any conventional pharmacological intervention as a monotherapy or a combination in overweight/obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and hyperandrogenism manifestations. Extracted data included three main parameters; I. Anthropometric parameters (BMI, Waist and Hip circumferences, and Waist/HIP ratio), II. Hormonal parameters (FSH, LH, FSG, SHBG, Estradiol, Total Testosterone, Free testosterone, DHEAS, Androstenedione), and III. Metabolic parameters (Total Cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, Triglycerides, Fasting glucose, Fasting glucose, HOMA-IR). Critical appraisal and risk of bias assessments were performed using the modified Jadad scale, and the overall quality of this network meta-analysis was evaluated according to the CINeMA framework. We performed both a pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effect sizes with 95% CI, and we calculated the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each intervention. Results Our final search on May 15th 2021 retrieved 23,305 unique citations from searching six electronic databases. Eventually, 101 RCTs of 108 reports with a total of 8,765 patients were included in our systematic review and multi-treatments meta-analysis. 55 different interventions were included: 22 monotherapies, and 33 combinations. The two-dimensional cluster ranking of the average SUCRA values for metabolic and hormonal parameters with significant estimates revealed flutamide (77.5%, 70%; respectively) as the highest and rosiglitazone (38.2%, 26.3%; respectively) as the lowest, in terms of the overall efficacy in reducing weight and hyperandrogenism. However, cyproterone-acetate+ethinylestradiol exhibited a higher ranking in improving hormonal parameters (71.1%), but even a lower-ranking regarding metabolic parameters (34.5%). Conclusions and relevance Current evidence demonstrated the superiority of flutamide in improving both metabolic and hormonal parameters, and the higher efficacy of cyproterone-acetate+ethinylestradiol only in improving hormonal parameters. Nearly all interventions were comparable in female hormones, FGS, HDL, glucose, and insulin levels improvements. © 2021 Abdel-Maboud et al.

It is a GLP-1 receptor agonist with downstream metabolic changes beyond the incretin system, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications. The understanding of these changes is critical for improving treatment outcomes. Herein, we present a post hoc experimental analysis using metabolomic phenotyping to discover molecular mecphanisms in response to liraglutide. Method: Plasma samples were obtained from The LiraFlame Study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03449654), a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial, including 102 participants with type 2 diabetes randomized to either liraglutide or placebo treatment for 26 weeks. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses were carried out on samples from baseline and the end of the trial. Metabolites (n=114) were categorized into pathways and linear mixed models were constructed to evaluate the association between changes in metabolites and liraglutide treatment. Results: We found the free fatty acid palmitoleate was significantly reduced in the liraglutide group compared to placebo (adjusted for multiple testing p-value = 0.04). The activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), the rate limiting enzyme for converting palmitate into palmitoleate, was found significantly downregulated by liraglutide treatment compared to placebo (p-value = 0.01). These metabolic changes have demonstrated to be linked to insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health.

Cagrilintide is a long-acting amylin analogue under investigation for weight management. We assessed the dose–response relationship of cagrilintide regarding the effects on bodyweight, safety, and tolerability. Methods: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, dose-finding phase 2 trial at 57 sites including hospitals, specialist clinics, and primary care centres in ten countries (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Japan, Poland, Serbia, South Africa, the UK, and the USA). Eligible participants were adults aged at least 18 years without diabetes, with a body-mass index of at least 30 kg/m2 or at least 27 kg/m2 with hypertension or dyslipidaemia. Participants were randomly assigned (6:1) to subcutaneous self-injections of once-weekly cagrilintide (0·3, 0·6, 1·2, 2·4, or 4·5 mg), once-daily liraglutide 3·0 mg, or volume-matched placebo (for six placebo groups). The trial had a 26-week treatment period, including a dose-escalation period of up to 6 weeks, and a 6-week follow-up period without treatment. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment with respect to active versus pooled placebo treatment, but not to different active treatments. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in bodyweight from baseline to week 26, assessed in all randomly assigned participants according to the trial product estimand (assuming all participants were adherent to treatment) and to the treatment policy estimand (regardless of adherence to treatment). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of randomised treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03856047, and is closed to new participants. Findings: Between March 1 and Aug 19, 2019, we randomly assigned 706 participants to cagrilintide 0·3–4·5 mg (100–102 per dose group), 99 to liraglutide 3·0 mg, and 101 to placebo. Permanent treatment discontinuation (n=73 [10%]) occurred similarly across treatment groups, mostly due to adverse events (n=30 [4%]). In total, 29 participants (4%) withdrew from the trial. According to the trial product estimand, mean percentage weight reductions from baseline were greater with all doses of cagrilintide (0·3–4·5 mg, 6·0%–10·8% [6·4–11·5 kg]) versus placebo (3·0% [3·3 kg]; estimated treatment difference range 3·0%–7·8%; p<0·001). Weight reductions were also greater with cagrilintide 4·5 mg versus liraglutide 3·0 mg (10·8% [11·5 kg] vs 9·0% [9·6 kg]; estimated treatment difference 1·8%, p=0·03). Similar weight loss reductions were observed with the treatment policy estimand. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (eg, nausea, constipation, and diarrhoea) and administration-site reactions. More participants receiving cagrilintide 0·3–4·5 mg had gastrointestinal adverse events compared with placebo (41%–63% vs 32%), primarily nausea (20%–47% vs 18%). Interpretation: Treatment with cagrilintide in people with overweight and obesity led to significant reductions in bodyweight and was well tolerated. The findings support the development of molecules with novel mechanisms of action for weight management.

In type 2 diabetes, correcting the impaired incretin system using GLP-1 agonist is a well-defined therapeutic strategy. Objectives: This review article aims to discuss the mechanism of action, key regulatory events, clinical trials for glycaemic control, and comparative analysis of semaglutide with the second-line antidiabetic drugs. Description: Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with enhanced glycaemic control in diabetes patients. In 2019, USFDA approved the first oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, to be administered as a once-daily tablet. Further, recent studies highlight the ability of semaglutide to improve Glycemic control in obese patients with a reduction in body weight. Still, in clinical practice, in the type 2 DM treatment paradigm, the impact of oral semaglutide remains unidentified. This review article discusses the mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, key regulatory events, and clinical trials regarding glycaemic control. Conclusion: The review highlights the comparative analysis of semaglutide with the existing second-line drugs for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus by stressing its benefits and adverse events. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers","GLP-1 receptor agonist; Glycemic control; Incretin system; Mechanism of action; Oral Semaglutide; Type 2 diabetes","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Glucagon-Like Peptides; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; albiglutide; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; empagliflozin; exendin 4; G protein coupled receptor; glucagon like peptide 1; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; insulin glargine; liraglutide; metformin; semaglutide; sitagliptin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; incretin; semaglutide; abdominal pain; Alzheimer disease; Article; body mass; body weight; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; constipation; diabetic nephropathy; diarrhea; estimated glomerular filtration rate; follow up; glycemic control; human; lipophilicity; maximum plasma concentration; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; Parkinson disease; pharmacokinetic parameters; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); plasma concentration-time curve; QTc interval; vomiting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126389238"

Materials and Methods: Adults who were overweight/obese (body mass index 27-40 kg/m2) with prediabetes were randomized to liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) versus placebo for 14 weeks. We used specific assays to measure exogenous (liraglutide, GLP-1 agonist [GLP-1A]) and endogenous (GLP-1E) GLP-1, alongside five other PGDP concentrations during a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) completed at baseline and at week 14 (liraglutide, n = 16; placebo, n = 19). Glucose during MMTT, steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration for insulin resistance and insulin secretion rate (ISR) were previously measured. MMTT area-under-the-curve (AUC) was calculated for ISR, glucose and levels of PGDPs. Results: Participants on liraglutide versus placebo had significantly (P ≤.004) decreased weight (mean −3.6%, 95% CI [−5.2% to −2.1%]), SSPG (−32% [−43% to −22%]) and glucose AUC (−7.0% [−11.5% to −2.5%]) and increased ISR AUC (30% [16% to 44%]). GLP-1A AUC at study end was significantly (P ≤.04) linearly associated with % decrease in weight (r = −0.54) and SSPG (r = −0.59) and increase in ISR AUC (r = 0.51) in the liraglutide group. Treatment with liraglutide significantly (P ≤.005) increased exogenous GLP-1A AUC (median 310 vs. 262 pg/mL × 8 hours at baseline but decreased endogenous GLP-1E AUC [13.1 vs. 24.2 pmol/L × 8 hours at baseline]), as well as the five other PGDPs. Decreases in the PGDPs processed in the intestines are independent of weight loss, indicating a probable direct effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists to decrease their endogenous production in contrast to weight loss-dependent changes in glucagon and major proglucagon fragment that are processed in pancreatic alpha cells. Conclusions: Circulating GLP-1A concentrations, reflecting liraglutide levels, predict improvement in weight, insulin action and secretion in a linear manner. Importantly, liraglutide also downregulates other PGDPs, normalization of the levels of which may provide additional metabolic and weight loss benefits in the future. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","clinical trial, control, GLP-1, GLP-1 analogue, glucagon, glycaemic, liraglutide","Adult; Body Weight; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Secretion; Liraglutide; Peptides; Proglucagon; glicentin; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 2; glucose; liraglutide; oxyntomodulin; placebo; proglucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; insulin; liraglutide; peptide; proglucagon; adult; Article; body mass; body weight loss; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug dose escalation; glucose homeostasis; glycemic control; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin release; insulin resistance; major clinical study; morning dosage; obesity; randomized controlled trial; body weight; metabolism","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096645050"

However, the effects and mechanisms of dapagliflozin on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) have not been fully evaluated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of dapagliflozin treatment on ABP in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Material/Methods: Patients were prospectively enrolled and divided into 2 groups: dapagliflozin treatment group (n=182) and no dapagliflozin treatment group (n=304). Clinical characteristics and measures of treatment, serum uric acid (SUA), 24-h urinary UA (UUA) excretion, and 24-h ABP were collected. The effects and mechanisms of dapagliflozin on 24-h ABP were evaluated. Results: After 3 months, the patients without dapagliflozin treatment had higher SUA, lower 24-h UUA excretion, and higher 24-h and daytime systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P<0.05) compared to patients with dapagliflozin treatment. After adjusting for covariates, results showed that dapagliflozin treatment was significantly associated with reduced 24-h SBP (b=–0.29 and P=0.02) and reduced daytime SBP (b=–0.33 and P=0.009). After additionally adjusting for SUA and 24-h UUA excretion, there were no significant relationships found between dapagliflozin treatment and 24-h (b=–012, P=0.10) and daytime SBP (b=–0.20, P=0.06). Conclusions: In patients with diabetes and hypertension, dapagliflozin treatment was associated with reduced 24-h and daytime SBP, which could be related to the drug’s effect of increasing 24-h UUA excretion. © Med Sci Monit, 2020; 26:","Arterial Pressure; Diabetes Complications; Uric Acid","Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Benzhydryl Compounds; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucosides; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; bone cement; C reactive protein; calcium channel blocking agent; creatinine; dapagliflozin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; empagliflozin; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; metformin; parathyroid hormone; pioglitazone; triacylglycerol; uric acid; antihypertensive agent; benzhydryl derivative; dapagliflozin; glucoside; acute kidney failure; adult; albumin to creatinine ratio; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; creatinine blood level; diabetic patient; diastolic blood pressure; drug effect; drug mechanism; dyslipidemia; electronic health record; end stage renal disease; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; glucose blood level; glucosuria; heart failure; human; hypertension; hyperuricemia; hypoglycemia; hypotension; kidney function; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; osmotic diuresis; peripheral occlusive artery disease; physical activity; sleep disordered breathing; sodium urine level; structured questionnaire; systolic blood pressure; uric acid blood level; aged; blood; blood pressure; blood pressure monitoring; clinical trial; diabetic complication; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091161833"

While weight loss medications have historically been considered “cosmetic”, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) also reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we assessed whether GLP1-RAs warrant use in patients who are overweight (body mass index 27.0–29.9 kg/m2) without weight-related comorbidity. We reviewed trials of available GLP1-RAs with a natural GLP1 backbone given their trend toward cardiovascular benefit and excluded trials requiring concurrent antidiabetic agents associated with weight gain. We assessed 20 phase III trials of GLP1-RAs studied in cardiovascular outcome trials. The GLP1-RAs consistently produced weight loss. Hypoglycemia risk with GLP1-RAs was generally low without other precipitating factors, whereas gastrointestinal adverse effects were common. Dulaglutide 1.5 mg weekly did not produce sufficient weight loss to support its use specifically for weight loss, while data supporting dulaglutide 3.0 or 4.5 mg weekly were limited to a single trial. Weight loss was sufficient with liraglutide 1.8 mg daily in one trial and was consistently sufficient with liraglutide 3.0 mg daily. Oral and injectable semaglutide at both doses consistently produced weight loss, though demonstrated a potential increased risk for retinopathy. Overall, we suggest five GLP1-RAs can be used in the treatment of overweight (body mass index 27.0–29.9 kg/m2 without weight-related comorbidity) with shared decision making to address each medications’ key limitation: liraglutide 1.8 mg daily (less demonstrated weight loss), liraglutide 3.0 mg daily (no cardiovascular outcome trial at this dose), and oral and injectable semaglutide at both doses (uncertain retinopathy risk and pending cardiovascular outcome trial of high-dose semaglutide). Use should be limited to patients who fail, refuse, or cannot access lifestyle interventions for weight loss, and should be accompanied by standard restrictions on and monitoring of weight loss medications. We expect additional and earlier use of weight loss therapies to help clinicians curb the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Cardiovascular Diseases; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Obesity; Overweight; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Weight Loss; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; dulaglutide; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; semaglutide; sulfonylurea derivative; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; adult; Article; body mass; body weight loss; cardiovascular risk; clinical outcome; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; drug megadose; gastrointestinal symptom; human; hypoglycemia; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); randomized controlled trial (topic); retinopathy; risk reduction; shared decision making; systematic review; body weight loss; cardiovascular disease; diabetic complication; drug effect; hypoglycemia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105410885"

Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved liraglutide as an anti-obesity drug for nondiabetic patients in 2014, it has been widely used for weight control in overweight and obese people. This study aimed to systematically analyze the effects of liraglutide on body weight and other cardiometabolic parameters. Methods: We investigated articles from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to search randomized clinical trials that ex amined body weight changes with liraglutide treatment. Results: We included 31 studies with 8,060 participants for this meta-analysis. The mean difference (MD) between the liraglutide group and the placebo group was -4.19 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.84 to -3.55), with a -4.16% change from the baseline (95% CI, -4.90 to -3.43). Liraglutide treatment correlated with a significantly reduced body mass index (MD: -1.55; 95% CI, -1.76 to -1.34) and waist circumference (MD: -3.11 cm; 95% CI, -3.59 to -2.62) and significantly decreased blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, MD: -2.85 mm Hg; 95% CI, -3.36 to -2.35; diastolic blood pressure, MD: -0.66 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.02 to -0.30), glycated hemoglobin (MD: -0.40%; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.31), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: -2.91 mg/dL; 95% CI, -5.28 to -0.53; MD: -0.87% change from baseline; 95% CI, -1.17 to -0.56). Conclusion: Liraglutide is effective for weight control and can be a promising drug for cardiovascular protection in overweight and obese people.

Data synthesis: This NMA includes randomized clinical trials comparing different head-to-head comparison trials with EMA-approved GLA in type 2 diabetes, with a duration of ≥52 weeks. All drugs have to be administered at the maximal approved dose. Primary endpoints were HbA1c at 12, 52, and 104+ weeks. Secondary endpoints were body weight, quality of life, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal disorders. Indirect comparisons of different GLA were performed by NMA choosing metformin as reference. The standardized difference in means (SDM) and Mantel-Haenzel Odds Ratio [MH–OR] (using random-effect models) with 95% Confidence Intervals were calculated for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. We included 68 trials fulfilling all inclusion criteria. At 12 weeks, when considering indirect comparisons, insulin secretagogues (IS) were associated with a significantly greater reduction in comparison with metformin (SDM, −0.3 [-0.4;-0.2]%); a significantly lower efficacy was observed for pioglitazone. At 52 weeks, IS were no longer associated with a greater reduction of HbA1c; whereas a significant decrease in HbA1c was observed for GLP-1 RA (SDM, −0.2 [-0.1;-0.3]%). At 104+ weeks, only SGLT-2 inhibitors showed a significantly greater HbA1c reduction (SDM, −0.2 [-0.1;-0.3]%), whereas sulfonylureas and insulin showed a significantly lower efficacy (SDM, 0.1 [0.0; 0.2]%), and 0.4 [0.3; 0.5]%, respectively).

Weight loss is an obvious management for this, but a major problem is that after weight loss, many people regain weight. Areas Covered: In the following evaluation of S-LITE (NCT04122716, Combined effects of GLP-1 analogue and exercise on maintenance of weight loss after very-low calorie diet), the author gives emphasis to the prevention of weight regain by liraglutide, not the effects of exercise. In S-LITE, liraglutide (with or without exercise) was effective in reducing weight regain in subjects with obesity. Expert opinion: The subjects with obesity in S-LITE were limited by the enrollment criteria, and the findings of S-LITE cannot be generalized. The increased heart rate with liraglutide did not occur when liraglutide was combined with exercise, and this suggests that liraglutide should probably not be used alone, but only with exercise to maintain weight loss. As the only presently available medicine to have been shown to be effective against weight regain, liraglutide should probably be preferred to other weight-loss medicines in this circumstance. However, without clear evidence that liraglutide treatment for obesity prevents diabetes and/or reduces cardiovascular risk, it is difficult to justify using it. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Clinical trial evaluation; liraglutide; obesity; S-LITE; weight regain","Anti-Obesity Agents; Diet; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Obesity; Weight Loss; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; liraglutide; adverse event; Article; body fat; body weight gain; body weight loss; cardiovascular risk; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; eligibility criteria; exercise; heart rate; human; increased appetite; neoplasm; obesity; phase 4 clinical trial (topic); very low calorie diet; body weight loss; diet; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122146522"

Consequently, there is a substantial and growing personal and economic burden necessitating the development of more effective therapies for obesity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogues (GLP-1RAs) are licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and there is substantial evidence that these drugs not only improve cardiovascular outcomes but also promote weight loss. More recent evidence supports the use of the GLP-1RAs liraglutide and semaglutide in people with obesity without T2D. This article discusses the results of the major cardiovascular outcome trials for GLP-1RAs in people with T2D, the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes study (Effect of liraglutide on body weight in non-diabetic obese subjects or overweight subjects with co-morbidities: SCALE™ - Obesity and Pre-diabetes; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01272219; investigating liraglutide) and the STEP studies (Semaglutide treatment effect in people with obesity; assorted studies; investigating subcutaneous semaglutide). We also highlight the importance of a cost-effective approach to obesity pharmacotherapy. Clinicians should consider the use of GLP-1RAs in people with obesity, especially those with T2D or other obesity-related diseases, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia.

Study design: Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Scopus databases from 01/01/1994-01/01/2021 for randomized control trials examining the weight, BMI, cardiometabolic, or gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists in children and adolescents with obesity. Data were extracted by 2 independent surveyors and a random effects model was applied to meta-analyze generic inverse variance outcomes. Primary outcomes were related to weight and cardiometabolic profile, and secondary outcomes of interest were gastrointestinal-related treatment-emergent adverse events. Results: Nine studies involving 574 participants were identified, of which 3 involved exenatide and 6 involved liraglutide. GLP-1 receptor agonists use caused a modest reduction in body weight (mean difference [MD] -1.50 [-2.50,-0.50] kg, I2 64%), BMI (MD -1.24 [-1.71,-0.77] kg/m2, I2 0%), and BMI z score (MD -0.14 [-0.23,-0.06], I2 43%). Glycemic control was improved in children with proven insulin resistance (glycated hemoglobin A1c MD -1.05 [-1.93,-0.18] %, I2 76%). Although no lipid profile improvements were noted, a modest decrease in systolic blood pressure was detected (MD -2.30 [-4.11,-0.49] mm Hg; I2 0%). Finally, analysis of gastrointestinal-related treatment-emergent adverse events revealed an increased risk of nausea (risk ratio 2.11 [1.44, 3.09]; I2 0%), without significant increases in other gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that GLP-1 receptor agonists are safe and effective in modestly reducing weight, BMI, glycated hemoglobin A1c, and systolic blood pressure in children and adolescents with obesity in a clinical setting, albeit with increased rates of nausea.

Treatment with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists has shown beneficial effects in NAFLD patients. We evaluated the effect of the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide on NAFLD features in women with pGDM. Eighty-two overweight/obese, nondiabetic women with pGDM were included. We performed abdominal ultrasound, transient elastography with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and blood sampling at baseline and after 1 year. Thirty-seven women were randomized to liraglutide (1.8 mg once-daily) and 45 to placebo. Based on the ultrasound scan, 18 women (22%) had ultrasound-verified NAFLD at baseline and of these, 10 (56%) received liraglutide treatment. After 1 year, eight participants no longer had steatosis, four in each treatment group. The number of participants who developed NAFLD was similar in the two treatment groups; five in the liraglutide group and six in the placebo group (p = 0.74). Compared to placebo, liraglutide reduced the CAP-assessed intrahepatic fat content (−28 (−44;−11) vs. 2 (−13;18) dB/m, p < 0.01) and body weight (−4.7 (−6.4;−2.9) vs. −1.4 (−3;0.3) kg, p < 0.01). One-year’s liraglutide treatment had no effect on the presence of ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in overweight/obese nondiabetic women with pGDM, but reduced body weight and steatosis assessed by transient elastography with CAP. © 2020 by the authors.

In an obstetrics and gynecology setting, frequently encountered obesity-related complications are polycystic ovary syndrome, fertility and pregnancy complications, and increased risk of breast and gynecological cancers. Obstetrician-gynecologists (OBGYNs) are uniquely positioned to diagnose and treat obesity, given their role in women's primary health care and the increasing prevalence of obesity-related fertility and pregnancy complications. The metabolic processes of bodyweight regulation are complex, which makes weight-loss maintenance challenging, despite dietary modifications and exercise. Antiobesity medications (AOMs) can facilitate weight loss by targeting appetite regulation. There are four AOMs currently approved for long-term use in the United States, of which liraglutide 3.0 mg is among the most efficacious. Liraglutide 3.0 mg, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), is superior to placebo in achieving weight loss and improving cardiometabolic profile, in both clinical trial and real-world settings. In addition, women with fertility complications receiving liraglutide 1.8-3.0 mg can benefit from improved ovarian function and fertility. Liraglutide 3.0 mg is generally well tolerated, but associated with transient gastrointestinal side effects, which can be mitigated. In this review, we present the risks of obesity and benefits of weight loss for women, and summarize clinical development of GLP-1 RAs for weight management. Finally, we provide practical advice and recommendations for OBGYNs to open the discussion about bodyweight with their patients, initiate lifestyle modification and GLP-1 RA treatment, and help them persist with these interventions to achieve optimal weight loss with associated health benefits. © Lisa Gill and Suzanne Mackey 2021; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2021.","GLP-1 RA; obesity; treatment adherence; treatment initiation; weight loss","Anti-Obesity Agents; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Weight Loss; antiobesity agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; placebo; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; Article; body weight loss; body weight management; disease course; disease risk assessment; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; evidence based medicine; gynecologist; human; lifestyle modification; long term care; maintenance therapy; obesity; obstetrician; patient compliance; risk benefit analysis; side effect; treatment response; women's health; female; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110120063"

There is a notable lack of valid and reliable means to manage patients with overweight/obesity and knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of liraglutide in a 30 mg/d dosing in patients with overweight/obesity and KOA. Methods: The trial was designed as a randomized controlled trial including patients between the age of 18 and 74 y with KOA and a BMI &ge;27 (measured in kg/m2). Patients underwent a pre-random assignment diet intervention (week-8 to 0). At week 0, patients having lost >5% of their body weight were randomly assigned to liraglutide 3 mg/d or placebo for 52 wk. The coprimary outcomes were changes in body weight and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain subscale from week 0 to 52. Results: In total, 168 patients enrolled and 156 were randomly assigned to receive liraglutide or placebo. Patients experienced a significant reduction in body weight and KOOS pain during the pre-random assignment dietary intervention period (week-8 to 0). From week 0 to 52 there was a significant difference in body weight between the liraglutide and placebo group (mean changes:-2.8 and +1.2 kg, respectively; group difference, 3.9 kg; 95% CI:-6.9,-1.0; P = 0.008). There was, however, no group difference in KOOS pain (mean changes: 0.4 and-0.6 points, respectively; group difference, 0.9 points; 95% CI:-3.9, 5.7; P = 0.71). Treatment-emergent adverse events related to the gastrointestinal system were experienced by 50.2% and 39.2% of patients in the liraglutide and placebo groups, respectively. Conclusions: In patients with KOA and overweight/obesity liraglutide added after an 8-wk pre-random assignment diet induced a significant weight loss at >52 wk but did not reduce knee pain compared to placebo. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

Each extra body weight kilogram increases the risk of cancer, including cancer of the oesophagus, kidneys, and pancreas, hepatocellular carcinoma, or cardia cancer stomach. In recent decades, an increase in the number of people affected by obesity has been observed. For this reason, the problem is now called the epidemic of obesity. This epidemic affects not only adults but also younger children. Regular physical activity and changing dietary habits are the basis of the treatment of obesity or overweight. In case when the intended therapeutic goals are not achieved, it is possible to start pharmacological treatment. Obesity treatment has changed significantly over the years. Many drugs with this indication, introduced into treatment in the 20th and 21st centuries, have been withdrawn due to the discovery of serious side effects. This concerned phentermine, mazindol, sibutramine, and rimonabant. Currently, there are four drugs for treating obesity available in Poland. The oldest of them, orlistat, was placed on the market in 1998. The combination of naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide have been available since 2015. In 2021, setmelanotide was registered, used only in cases of obesity resulting from rare genetic diseases. In this article, a review of their chemical structure, mechanism of action, effectiveness, and adverse reactions was carried out. Furthermore, semaglutide was described, the second after liraglutide drug from the group of the incretin hormone analogs, glucagon-like peptide 1. In Poland, it is registered only as an antidiabetic drug, but in the United States, it has also been used as an antiobesity drug since 2021. The presence of this drug on the market and the promising results of clinical trials mean that it is prescribed off-label for the treatment of obesity also in Poland. New therapies for obesity treatment give hope for effective and less risky problem solution than bariatric surgery. It should be remembered that only the combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and pharmacological treatment gives the best and most lasting results in obesity therapy.  © 2023 Polskie Towarzystwo Farmaceutyczne.","liraglutide; naltrexone/bupropion; obesity; orlistat; semaglutide; setmelanotide","amfebutamone plus naltrexone; antiobesity agent; liraglutide; mazindol; phentermine; rimonabant; semaglutide; setmelanotide; sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; Article; bariatric surgery; healthy diet; human; obesity; Poland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164947806"

Here, we evaluated serum fetuin-B levels in women with newly diagnosed MetS and performed multiple interventions to investigate the role of fetuin-B in the pathogenesis of MetS. Serum fetuin-B levels were assessed using ELISA. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to analyze fetuin-B-related genes and signaling pathways. Additionally, oxidative stress parameters were measured in the in vitro study. For subgroup analyses, we performed EHC, OGTT, and treatment with a GLP-1RA to investigate the regulatory factors of serum fetuin-B. We found that in comparison with healthy subjects, serum fetuin-B levels were markedly increased in women with MetS. Further, serum fetuin-B showed a positive correlation with WHR, FAT%, TG, FBG, HbA1c, FIns, HOMA-IR, VAI, and LAP. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that most fetuin-B-related core genes were involved in cholesterol metabolism and fat decomposition. Consistent with this finding, multivariate regression analysis showed that triglyceride content and WHR were independently associated with serum fetuin-B. We also observed that serum fetuin-B levels were markedly elevated in healthy subjects after glucose loading and in women with MetS during EHC. In vitro, overexpression of fetuin-B promoted oxidative stress in HepG2 cell. After 6 months of treatment with a GLP-1RA, serum fetuin-B levels in women with MetS decreased following an improvement in metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Therefore, serum fetuin-B is associated with MetS, which may serve as a biomarker of oxidative stress. This trial is registered with ChiCTR-OCC-11001422.  © 2021 Shiyao Xue et al.","","Cores; Genes; Glucose; Metabolism; Processing; Regression Analysis; Stresses; Women; Adult; Biomarkers; Female; Fetuin-B; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Oxidative Stress; Triglycerides; Young Adult; Bioinformatics; Metabolism; Multivariant analysis; Oxidative stress; Regression analysis; apolipoprotein A4; apolipoprotein B100; fatty acid; fetuin A; fetuin B; glucose; glutathione; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; human insulin; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; malonaldehyde; phosphoprotein; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; triacylglycerol; biological marker; fetuin B; triacylglycerol; Bioinformatics analysis; Healthy subjects; In-vitro; Metabolic disease; Metabolic syndromes; Multiple interventions; Regulatory factors; Signalling pathways; Stress parameter; Vitro studies; adult; Article; body mass; Chinese; cholesterol blood level; clinical feature; controlled study; core gene; cross-sectional study; drug dose increase; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; homeostasis model assessment; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; hypertension; impaired glucose tolerance; in vitro study; lipid accumulation product index; major clinical study; metabolic parameters; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; oxidative stress; protein blood level; protein protein interaction; triacylglycerol blood level; waist hip ratio; biosynthesis; blood; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; oxidative stress; physiology; young adult; Genes","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117386686"

Short message service (SMS) can potentially improve adherence. Methods: A total of 3,994 participants with overweight or obesity in Australia receiving Saxenda® (liraglutide 3.0 mg) were enrolled from September 1, 2017, to February 28, 2018, through doctors, pharmacists, or websites and were randomly assigned to receive none, three, or five SMS per week. Participants were additionally offered a face-to-face consultation with a diabetes educator or a call from a dietitian. Medication adherence was measured as whether the total scripts claimed were at least as many as the total claims expected by March 31, 2018, and was modeled adjusting for age, sex, baseline BMI, residential region, enrolment channel, the total number of SMS, and additional patient support. Results: Participants receiving five SMS (OR, 6.25; 95% CI: 4.28-9.12) had greater adherence than those receiving three SMS (OR, 3.67; 95% CI: 2.67-5.03) or zero SMS per week. The effectiveness of SMS on adherence decreased as participants received more SMS over time. Moreover, the odds of adhering to liraglutide were higher for participants enrolled with pharmacists compared with those enrolled with doctors (OR, 2.28; 95% CI: 1.82-2.86) and for participants who received a face-to-face consultation (OR, 3.10; 95% CI: 1.82-5.29) or a call (OR, 1.31; 95% CI: 1.02-1.68) compared with those who received no extra support. Conclusions: Integration of SMS into routine clinical practice should consider not only the frequency and content of reminders but also additional patient support to achieve higher and more sustained adherence to medication and health behavior changes. © 2020 The Authors.

Among them, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a multisystem human genomic imprinting disorder characterized by overgrowth. We describe the first case of liraglutide treatment in an 18-year-old boy patient affected by BWS complicated by macroglossia, cryptorchidism, nephroblastoma, organomegaly, microscopic lymphocytic colitis, pharmacologically treated arterial hypertension, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. He presented a normal cognitive development. Body mass index at the time of first transition visit in the adult endocrinology department at the age of 18-years-old was 40.6 kg/m2 without glucose metabolism impairment. Lifestyle interventions failed because of poor compliance. During 20 months of 3.0 mg liraglutide treatment, a weight loss of 19 kg (−13.3%) and BMI reduction of 6.8 points were registered without side effects. To date, liraglutide treatment was effective on obesity in 7 subjects with Prader Willy Syndrome and 14 with melanocortin-4 receptor mutations. The efficacy of liraglutide in BWS could be related to a crosstalk among glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 system, mechanisms related to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C), and dopamine mesolimbic circuit. Clinical trials aiming at a tailored medicine in genetic obesity are needed. © Copyright © 2021 Caputo, Daffara, Bellone, Mancioppi, Marzullo, Aimaretti and Prodam.","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; liraglutide; obesity; syndromic obesity; weight","amlodipine; cetirizine; colecalciferol; corticotropin; ferrous sulfate; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydrocortisone; insulin; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; prolactin; ramipril; somatomedin C; triacylglycerol; abdominal pain; adult; anthropometry; Article; Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome; case report; cesarean section; clinical article; cognitive development; colitis; cryptorchism; Doppler ultrasonography; electrocardiography; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; heart rate; hepatomegaly; human; hyperphagia; hyperplasia; hypertension; macroglossia; macrosomia; male; mitral valve regurgitation; myringoplasty; nephroblastoma; noninvasive ventilation; obesity; omphalocele; oral glucose tolerance test; otitis; physical activity; pneumothorax; quality of life; rectum hemorrhage; sleep disordered breathing; waist circumference","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109181833"

Asians, particularly the Southeast Asian population, may have a higher genetic predisposition to diabetes and increased exposure to environmental and social risk factors. Malaysia alone was home to 3.4 million people with diabetes in 2017; the figure is estimated to reach 6.1 million by 2045. Developing strategies for early interventions to treat prediabetes and preventing the development of overt diabetes and subsequent cardiovascular and microvascular complications are therefore important. Methods: An expert panel comprising regional experts was convened in Kuala Lumpur, for a one-day meeting, to develop a document on prediabetes management in Malaysia. The expert panel comprised renowned subject-matter experts and specialists in diabetes and endocrinology, primary-care physicians, as well as academicians with relevant expertise. Results: Fifteen key clinical statements were proposed. The expert panel reached agreements on several important issues related to the management of prediabetes providing recommendations on the screening, diagnosis, lifestyle and pharmacological management of prediabetes. The expert panel also proposed changes in forthcoming clinical practice guidelines and suggested that the government should advocate early screening, detection, and intensive management of prediabetes. Conclusion: This document provides a comprehensive approach to the management of prediabetes in Malaysia in their daily activities and offer help in improving government policies and the decision-making process. © 2020, Malaysian Medical Association.

Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for the diabetes-related increase in cardiovascular risk, i.e. chronic hyperglycemia, duration of the disease, drug-induced hypoglycemia, coexistence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, etc. In the last few years, new pharmacological approaches capable of treating chronic hyperglycemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia have emerged for the treatment of diabetes. Data synthesis: With data mainly obtained from randomized controlled trials recruiting patients with type 2 diabetes in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, some of these newer antihyperglycemic drugs have shown to significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, the combined control of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, e.g. dyslipidemia, hypertension, etc., has demonstrated to be effective in reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: In this document written by some experts of the Italian diabetes society (SID), we will focus our attention on oral antihyperglycemic agents for people with type 2 diabetes in primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, excluding for brevity the injection therapies for diabetes, such as insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. © 2020 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","Cardiovascular diseases; CVD prevention; Diabetes","Administration, Oral; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glycemic Control; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Primary Prevention; Protective Factors; Risk Assessment; Secondary Prevention; Treatment Outcome; adiponectin; alogliptin; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antilipemic agent; calcium channel blocking agent; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; empagliflozin; evolocumab; exendin 4; ezetimibe; glibenclamide; gliclazide; glimepiride; glitazone derivative; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; incretin; insulin; linagliptin; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; repaglinide; saxagliptin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea; thiazide diuretic agent; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; albuminuria; antidiabetic activity; aortic rupture; Article; attention; bladder cancer; bloating; blood glucose monitoring; brain ischemia; caloric intake; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; clinical article; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; diastolic blood pressure; drug safety; drug therapy; dyslipidemia; estimated glomerular filtration rate; fluid retention; glomerulus filtration rate; glucose blood level; glucosuria; glycemic control; headache; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle revascularization; heart rehabilitation; hospitalization; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypoglycemia; hypotension; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin treatment; kidney function; lifestyle modification; liver cell carcinoma; maximum tolerated dose; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; orthostatic hypotension; osmotic diuresis; peripheral occlusive artery disease; physical activity; prescription; prevalence; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; risk factor; secondary prevention; systolic blood pressure; blood; cardiovascular disease; drug effect; glycemic control; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oral drug administration; primary prevention; protection; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090860686"

It shares clinical and metabolic features with both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Patients with LADA may initially be diagnosed incorrectly as having T2DM based on their age, particularly if they have risk factors for T2DM such as a strong family history or obesity. The diagnosis of LADA is typically based on the finding of hyperglycemia together with the clinical impression that β-cell failure rather than insulin resistance (IR) is the main cause; detection of a low C-peptide and raised antibodies against the islets of Langerhans support the diagnosis. Highly variable β-cell destruction, different degrees of IR and heterogeneous titer and pattern of islet autoantibody, suggesting different pathophysiological pathways partially explaining the heterogeneous phenotypes of LADA. The decline in β-cell function progresses much faster in LADA than in T2DM, presumably because of the ongoing autoimmune assault in LADA, and therefore necessitates insulin therapy much earlier in LADA than in T2DM. The existence of heterogeneous phenotypes in LADA makes it difficult to establish an a priori treatment algorithm, and therefore, an individualized pharmaceutical therapy is required to preserve residual β-cell function and attain optimal diabetic control to decrease the risk of long-term diabetic complications in patients with LADA. This article aims to give an overview of the current understanding and gaps in knowledge regarding epidemiology, clinical and metabolic features, genetics, immunology, complications and therapeutic strategy of LADA and summarize an update on results from recent studies on the treatment of the disease. © 2021 Society of Internal Medicine of Taiwan.

Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the conventional treatment for OSA, can be poor and considering weight loss is the most effective treatment for OSA. This trial examines whether the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, a glucose-lowering therapy associated with significant weight loss used in T2DM, can improve the severity and symptoms of OSA. Methods and analysis This is an outpatient, single-centred, open-labelled, prospective, phase IV randomised controlled trial in a two-by-two factorial design. One hundred and thirty-two patients with newly diagnosed OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥15 events/hour), and existing obesity and T2DM (glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) ≥47 mmol/mol), will be recruited from diabetes and sleep medicine outpatient clinics in primary and secondary care settings across Liverpool. Patients will be allocated equally, using computer-generated random, permuted blocks of unequal sizes, to each of the four treatment arms for 26 weeks: (i) liraglutide (1.8 mg once per day) alone, (ii) liraglutide 1.8 mg once per day with CPAP, (iii) CPAP alone (conventional care) or (iv) no treatment (control). The primary outcome measure is change in OSA severity, determined by AHI. Secondary outcome measures include effects on glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)), body weight and quality of life measures. Exploratory measures include measures of physical activity, MRI-derived measures of regional body composition including fat mass (abdominal subcutaneous, visceral, neck and liver fat) and skeletal muscle mass (cross-sectional analysis of thigh), indices of cardiac function (using transthoracic echocardiography) and endothelial function.

Reduction of a dilated LSG using the revisional endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (R-ESG) approach is an appealing and minimally invasive alternative to surgical revision that is congruent with obesity as a chronic relapsing disease model. In this study, we examine the safety and efficacy of the technique in a large multicenter international cohort. Methods: Prospectively collected data from 9 centers for 82 consecutive adults who underwent R-ESG for weight regain after LSG using the OverStitch device (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Tex, USA) from March 2014 to November 2019 were reviewed. Total body weight loss (TBWL) and adverse events were reported up to 12 months. Univariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of response at 12 months. Results: Eighty-two adults (92.7% female) experienced 27.9 ± 20.7 kg weight regain from post-LSG nadir weight, prompting R-ESG (mean age, 42.8 ± 10.4 years) at a mean weight of 128.2 ± 57.5 kg. Mean R-ESG procedure duration was 48.3 ± 20.5 minutes, and the median number of sutures used was 4 (interquartile range, 3-4). After R-ESG, TBWL (follow-up %) was 6.6% ± 3.2% at 1 month (81.7%), 10.6% ± 4.4% at 3 months (74.4%), 13.2% ± 10.1% at 6 months (63.4%), and 15.7% ± 7.6% at 12 months (51.2%). In a per-protocol analysis, ≥10% TBWL was achieved by 37 of 51 patients (72.5%) at 6 months and 34 of 42 patients (81.0%) at 12 months; ≥15% TBWL was achieved by 20 of 46 patients (43.5%) at 6 months and 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) at 12 months. Only 1 moderate adverse event occurred in the form of a narrowed gastroesophageal junction, which resolved after a single endoscopic dilation. Conclusions: R-ESG is a safe and effective means of facilitating weight loss for weight recidivism after LSG, with sustained results at 1 year. R-ESG should be considered before pursuing more-invasive surgical revisional options. © 2021 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","","Adult; Female; Gastrectomy; Gastroplasty; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; liraglutide; phentermine; phentermine plus topiramate; proton pump inhibitor; adult; Article; body weight; body weight gain; body weight loss; cohort analysis; controlled study; dehydration; endoscopic surgery; endoscopist; female; gastroesophageal junction; gastroesophageal reflux; gastroplasty; hematemesis; human; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; operation duration; patient selection; priority journal; prospective study; recidivism; recurrent disease; revisional endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty; surgical technique; vomiting; clinical trial; gastrectomy; laparoscopy; middle aged; morbid obesity; retrospective study; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090484406"

In animal models, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonizts (GLP1-RAs) have been shown to exert neuroprotective effects, expecially in the memory domain. We assessed whether treatment with a GLP1-RA might affect cognitive functions in type 2 diabetic subjects independently on the weight loss it might induce. Subjects/methods: Forty metformin-treated obese subjects with prediabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus, received liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) (n = 20) or lifestyle counseling (dietary intervention and exercise training) (n = 20) until achieving a modest and comparable weight loss (−7% of initial body weight). Interventions/methods: A detailed neuropsychological assessment before and after weight loss was completed in 16 patients per arm, who were administered a total of seven psychological tests, thus assessing three composite domain z-scores for attention, memory, and executive control. Results: After comparable weight loss and superimposable glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, a significant increase in short term memory (mean Digit Span Z score from −0.06 to 0.80, p = 0.024) and memory composite z-score (mean memory z-score from −0.67 to 0.032, p = 0.0065) was observed in the liraglutide exposed subjects (between group p = 0.041 and p = 0.033, respectively). Conclusions: Liraglutide might slow down memory function decline in diabetic patients in early, and possibly preclinical stages of the disease. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Life Style; Liraglutide; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Memory; Metformin; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Obesity; Prediabetic State; Psychometrics; Weight Loss; C peptide; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; adult; Article; attention; bedtime dosage; body weight loss; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; diabetes education; diabetic patient; dietary intake; drug dose titration; executive function; exercise; female; forward digit span; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; lifestyle modification; longitudinal study; male; memory; neuropsychological test; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obese patient; obesity; priority journal; psychologic test; randomized controlled trial; Rey Osterrieth complex figure test; short term memory; trail making test; verbal fluency test; impaired glucose tolerance; lifestyle; memory; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; psychometry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078304662"

SGLT2 inhibitors ameliorate cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as kidney disease progression by reducing body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), visceral adiposity, albuminuria, and serum uric acid and blood glucose levels. However, it is not clear which effects are pronounced, and what mechanisms are associated with these effects. Material/Methods: This study recruited patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor for the first time in our outpatient department. Clinical parameters were measured before and 6 months after the administration of the SGLT2 inhibitor, without the addition of new drugs and dose changes for all prescribed drugs. Results: This study recruited 24 patients with type 2 diabetes. No significant differences in BP, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed after SGLT2 inhibitor administration. In contrast, BW and serum uric acid levels decreased significantly, and the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA) increased significantly after administration. While no significant relationships were observed between serum uric acid and FEUA with respect to the percentage changes from baseline values, the percentage changes in serum uric acid levels from baseline were significantly and positively associated with those in serum creatinine levels. Conclusions: Serum uric acid levels were immediately decreased owing to the administration of SGLT2 inhibitor, but BP, blood glucose, and serum lipid levels were unchanged. These changes in serum uric acid levels may be associated with changes in renal function. © Med Sci Monit, 2020; 26:","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; Uric Acid","Adiposity; Aged; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Time Factors; Uric Acid; bilirubin; canagliflozin; creatinine; cystatin C; dapagliflozin; empagliflozin; etanercept; glucose; hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; pioglitazone; probenecid; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea; triacylglycerol; urate transporter; uric acid; SLC5A2 protein, human; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; adult; albuminuria; Article; blood pressure; body mass; body weight; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; diabetic nephropathy; diastolic blood pressure; disease exacerbation; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; glucose blood level; glucose intake; glucosuria; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hyperuricemia; hyperuricosuria; insulin resistance; kidney disease; kidney function test; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; morbidity; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; proteinuria; uric acid blood level; urinalysis; urinary excretion fraction; administration and dosage; aged; blood; clinical trial; drug effect; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; time factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091133927"

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor-1-alpha (SDF-1ɑ), both of which are implicated in endothelial function, were higher at 26 weeks with liraglutide therapy compared with sitagliptin (mean between-group difference [95% CI]: 77.03 [18.29, 135.77] pg/mL, p =.010; and 996.25 [818.85, 1173.64] pg/mL, p <.001, respectively). There were no between-group differences in CPCs, nitric oxide, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor alpha and advanced glycation end-products. These analyses suggest a favourable impact of liraglutide on VEGF and SDF-1ɑ levels compared with sitagliptin. These factors may therefore be implicated in the differential cardiovascular effects observed between these agents in large cardiovascular outcome trials. However, these are secondary analyses from a previous trial and thus hypothesis-generating. Purposive trials are required to examine these findings further. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","liraglutide; randomized active-comparator trial; sitagliptin; stromal cell-derived factor-1-alpha; type 2 diabetes; vascular endothelial growth factor","Adult; Biomarkers; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Middle Aged; Obesity; Sitagliptin Phosphate; Stem Cells; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; advanced glycation end product; biological marker; C reactive protein; CD133 antigen; CD34 antigen; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; interleukin 6; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nitric oxide; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; sitagliptin; stromal cell derived factor 1alpha; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; sitagliptin; vasculotropin A; adult; antigen expression; Article; atherosclerosis; body mass; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; disease association; disease duration; drug effect; endothelial progenitor cell; female; hemoglobin blood level; human; human cell; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oxidative stress; randomized controlled trial (topic); vasodilatation; complication; middle aged; obesity; stem cell","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101646708"

Incentive motivation refers to the processes that translate an expected reward into the effort spent to obtain the reward; the magnitude and probability of a reward involved in prompting motivated behaviour are encoded by the dopaminergic (DA) midbrain and its mesoaccumbens DA projections. This type of reward circuity is particularly sensitive to the metabolic state signalled by peripheral mediators, such as insulin or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). While in rodents the modulatory effect of metabolic state signals on motivated behaviour is well documented, evidence of state-dependent modulation and the role of incentive motivation underlying overeating in humans is lacking. Methods: In a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 21 lean (body mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m2) and 16 obese (BMI³ 30 kg/m2) volunteer participants received either liraglutide as a GLP-1 analogue or placebo on two separate testing days. Incentive motivation was measured using a behavioural task in which participants were required to exert physical effort using a handgrip to win different amounts of food and monetary rewards. Hunger levels were measured using visual analogue scales; insulin, glucose, and systemic insulin resistance as assessed by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were quantified at baseline. Results: In this report, we demonstrate that incentive motivation increases with hunger in lean humans (F(1,42) = 5.31, p = 0.026, β = 0.19) independently of incentive type (food and non-food reward). This effect of hunger is not evident in obese humans (F(1,62) = 1.93, p = 0.17, β = −0.12). Motivational drive related to hunger is affected by peripheral insulin sensitivity (two-way interaction, F(1, 35) = 6.23, p = 0.017, β = −0.281). In humans with higher insulin sensitivity, hunger increases motivation, while poorer insulin sensitivity dampens the motivational effect of hunger. The GLP-1 analogue application blunts the interaction effect of hunger on motivation depending on insulin sensitivity (three-way interaction, F(1, 127) = 5.11, p = 0.026); no difference in motivated behaviour could be found between humans with normal or impaired insulin sensitivity under GLP-1 administration. Conclusion: We report a differential effect of hunger on motivation depending on insulin sensitivity. We further revealed the modulatory role of GLP-1 in adaptive, motivated behaviour in humans and its interaction with peripheral insulin sensitivity and hunger. Our results suggest that GLP-1 might restore dysregulated processes of midbrain DA function and hence motivational behaviour in insulin-resistant humans. © 2021 The Author(s)","Glucagon-like peptide-1; Hunger; Insulin sensitivity; Obesity; Regulation of motivational behaviour","Adult; Body Mass Index; Brain; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Hand Strength; Humans; Hunger; Hyperphagia; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Liraglutide; Male; Motivation; Obesity; Reward; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; novo nordisk; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; insulin; liraglutide; adult; Article; behavior assessment; body composition; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; drug blood level; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; HOMA index; human; hunger; incentive; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lean body weight; male; metabolic parameters; motivation; obesity; randomized controlled trial; task performance; visual analog scale; body mass; brain; genetics; hand strength; hunger; hyperphagia; insulin resistance; metabolism; motivation; physiology; reward","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100240769"

Once daily subcutaneous administration of 3 mg liraglutide, a glucagon like peptide-1 analogue, has been shown to induce weight loss in clinical trials, but real-world effectiveness data are scarce. Methods: It is a single-centre retrospective cohort study of patients who were prescribed liraglutide on top of lifestyle adaptations after multidisciplinary evaluation. In Belgium, liraglutide is only indicated for weight management if the BMI is >30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with comorbidities such as dysglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, or obstructive sleep apnoea. No indication is covered by the compulsory health care insurance. Liraglutide was started at 0.6 mg/day and uptitrated weekly until 3 mg/day or the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment status and body weight were evaluated at the 4-month routine visit. Results: Between June 2016 and January 2020, liraglutide was prescribed to 115 patients (77% female), with a median age of 47 (IQR 37.7-54.0) years, a median body weight of 98.4 (IQR 90.0-112.2) kg, a BMI of 34.8 (IQR 32.2-37.4) kg/m2<, and an HbA1c level of 5.6%. Five (4%) patients did not actually initiate treatment, 9 (8%) stopped treatment, and 8 (7%) were lost to follow-up. At the 4-month visit, the median body weight had decreased significantly by 9.2% to 90.8 (IQR 82.0-103.5) kg (p < 0.001). Patients using 3.0 mg/day (n = 60) had lost 8.0 (IQR 5.8-10.4) kg. The weight loss was similar (p = 0.9622) in patients that used a lower daily dose because of intolerance: 7.4 (IQR 6.2-9.6) kg for 1.2 mg (n = 3), 7.8 (IQR 4.1-7.8) kg for 1.8 mg (n = 16), and 9.0 (IQR 4.8-10.7) kg for 2.4 mg/day (n = 14). Weight loss was minimal if liraglutide treatment was not started or stopped prematurely (median 3.0 [IQR 0.3-4.8] kg, p < 0.001, vs. on treatment). Further analysis showed an additional weight reduction of 1.8 kg in the patients that had started metformin <3 months before the start of liraglutide (p < 0.001). The main reasons for liraglutide discontinuation were gastrointestinal complaints (n = 5/9) and drug cost (n = 2/9). Conclusion: In this selected group of patients, the majority complied with liraglutide treatment over the initial 4-month period and achieved a significant weight loss, irrespective of the maximally tolerated maintenance dose. Addition of metformin induced a small but significant additional weight loss.  © 2021 The Author(s). Published by S.

This discrete choice experiment explored preferences for (unbranded) oral and injectable GLP-1 RA profiles among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: An online survey was designed using literature review and qualitative interview findings, and administered to Japanese patients with T2D and HbA1c ≥ 7.0% receiving oral antiglycaemic medication (with no experience of injectable antiglycaemic medication). Therapy profiles were created using Japanese head-to-head trial data for orally administered semaglutide (7 mg and 14 mg), injectable dulaglutide (0.75 mg), and injectable liraglutide (0.9 mg). Profiles were not labelled. Choice tasks tested preference between hypothetical profiles, preference between profiles with actual trial data, and willingness to initiate treatment. Relative importance of attributes was determined using conditional logit regression. Results: A total of 500 respondents were analysed: mean age 61.2 years; 93.8% male; mean HbA1c 7.6%; 78.2% with HbA1c ≥ 7.0 to < 8%; 89% with HbA1c above personal target. Mean BMI was 25.4 kg/m2; 49% had obesity (≥ 25 kg/m2). The treatment attribute with greatest importance was mode and frequency of administration (49.1%), followed by nausea risk (30.8%), weight change (11.3%), and HbA1c change (8.8%). Oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg-like profiles were both preferred: the 7 mg-like profile was preferred over dulaglutide (by 91.0% of respondents) and liraglutide (by 89.4%); the 14 mg-like profile was preferred over dulaglutide (by 88.2%) and liraglutide (by 94.4%). Willingness to initiate treatment was also higher for orally administered semaglutide-like profiles: 62.4% with 7 mg and 64.0% with 14 mg, versus 13.6% and 11.0% with injectable GLP-1 RA-like profiles. Subgroup results were generally consistent with the overall sample. Conclusion: Japanese patients with T2D appear to prefer oral GLP-1 RA profiles over injectable GLP-1 RA profiles, and administration appears to be the most important factor in this decision. This highlights the unmet need for an effective and orally administered GLP-1 RA for the treatment of T2D in Japan. © 2020, The Author(s).","Discrete choice experiment; GLP-1 receptor agonist; Patient preference; Type 2 diabetes (T2D)","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Glucagon-Like Peptides; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; antidiabetic agent; dulaglutide; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; semaglutide; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; adult; aged; Article; body mass; body weight change; clinical trial; drug choice; female; human; Japanese (people); maintenance drug dose; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient participation; patient preference; risk assessment; Japan","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096771512"

Metabolic adaptation leads to systematic weight regain following weight-loss efforts, and new obesity treatments should therefore aim to induce long-standing double-digit weight loss, and thus improve and even reverse obesity-associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. Until now, only metabolic surgery has been able to achieve such a goal, but this invasive procedure cannot be offered on a large scale. Among the alternatives, lifestyle interventions and drug therapies have often been disappointing. The recent availability of once-weekly subcutaneous 2.4 mg semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; Wegovy™; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark) has changed the scene, and semaglutide is considered a ‘game changer’ in the treatment of obesity. The results from the phase III STEP (Semaglutide treatment effect in people with obesity) clinical programme have shown that semaglutide provides clinically meaningful and sustained weight loss in ranges much higher than those achieved with previously available pharmacotherapies. These results led to the approval of semaglutide by regulatory authorities as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in people with obesity or overweight, with at least one weight-related comorbidity. With data from phase II and III clinical trials showing that newer drugs (i.e. the glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide dual receptor agonist tirzepatide and the amylin agonist cagrilintide, either alone or combined) produce a greater sustained weight loss than semaglutide, an upstream ‘weight-centric’ strategy has emerged as a new standard for the treatment of type 2 diabetes © Touch Medical Media 2022","Obesity; Semaglutide; Step clinical programme; Treatment of obesity; Weight loss; Weight-centric approach","glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin detemir; liraglutide; lorcaserin; metformin; semaglutide; anxiety; Article; bariatric surgery; body composition; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; depression; diastolic blood pressure; energy expenditure; exercise; gastroesophageal reflux; glucose blood level; heart failure; human; hypertension; insulin sensitivity; life expectancy; nausea and vomiting; obesity; pathophysiology; physical activity; questionnaire; stomach emptying; waist circumference","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138580545"

Objectives: To assess the effects of liraglutide vs placebo on body mass index (BMI) and weight parameters in children and adolescents with T2D using data from the ellipse trial (NCT01541215). Methods: The ellipse trial randomized participants (10-<17 years old, BMI >85th percentile, T2D, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.0%-11.0% [if diet- and exercise-treated] or 6.5% to 11.0% [if treated with metformin, basal insulin or both]) to liraglutide or placebo. This post-hoc analysis evaluated changes from baseline to weeks 26 and 52 in absolute BMI, percent change in BMI and other weight-related parameters. Changes were assessed by liraglutide overall (all doses) and liraglutide by dose (0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day) vs placebo using a pattern mixture model of observed data, with missing observations imputed from each treatment group. Results: In total, 134 participants were included. There were statistically significant differences between groups in certain parameters, including absolute BMI (estimated treatment difference [ETD] –0.89 kg/m2; 95% confidence interval [CI] –1.71,–0.06) and percent change in BMI (ETD –2.73%; 95% CI –5.15,–0.30) at week 52, but none at week 26. Dose-dependent effects were not observed for liraglutide vs placebo for all BMI/weight parameters. Conclusions: Compared with placebo, liraglutide was associated with statistically significant reductions in BMI/weight parameters at week 52, but not week 26, in children and adolescents with T2D. © 2021 World Obesity Federation.","anti-obesity agents; body mass index; liraglutide; paediatric obesity; weight","Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Liraglutide; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; antiobesity agent; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; glycosylated hemoglobin; liraglutide; adolescent; Article; body mass; body weight; child; childhood obesity; controlled study; dietary intake; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug dose titration; drug effect; drug use; female; glucose blood level; human; male; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phase 3 clinical trial; post hoc analysis; randomized controlled trial; body weight loss; drug effect; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101660950"

Patients were categorized by body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) into obesity class I (BMI 30–34.9); class II (BMI 35–39.9); and class III (BMI ≥40). Change in weight, categorical weight loss, time to maintenance dose (defined as the time to reach the full liraglutide 3.0 mg maintenance dose) and persistence were assessed for each class and for differences between classes. Results: Of 308 patients, 70 (22.7%) had obesity class I, 83 (26.9%) obesity class II and 155 (50.3%) obesity class III. Similar percentage change in weight was observed between obesity classes (mean [standard deviation, SD]: −7.0% [6.0], −6.6% [6.0] and −6.1% [5.0], respectively; p =.640), and similar proportions achieved ≥5% weight loss (60.4%, 62.0% and 55.3%, respectively; p =.717) at 6 months. Mean time to maintenance dose (SD) was 64.2 (56.4) d, 76.4 (56.3) d and 71.4 (54.5) d for obesity classes I, II and III, respectively (p =.509). Persistence with medication was also similar between obesity classes (p =.358). Conclusions: These findings suggest that real-world treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg, regardless of obesity class, is associated with similar clinically significant weight loss, time to maintenance dose and medication persistence. © 2020 The Authors.

Effective treatments for appetite suppression and weight control are currently unavailable for PWS. Our aim to further understand the pathogenesis of PWS led us to carry out a comprehensive search of the current and emerging therapies for managing hyperphagia and extreme weight gain in PWS. A literature search was performed using PubMed and the following keywords: “PWS” AND “therapy” OR “[drug name]”; reference lists, pharmaceutical websites, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were also reviewed. Articles presenting data from current standard treatments in PWS and also clinical trials of pharmacological agents in the pipeline were selected. Current standard treatments include dietary restriction/modifications, exercise, and growth hormone replacement, which appear to have limited efficacy for appetite and weight control in patients with PWS. The long-term safety and effectiveness of bariatric surgery in PWS remains unknown. However, many promising pharmacotherapies are in development and, if approved, will bring much needed choices into the PWS pharmacological armamentarium. With the progress that is currently being made in our understanding of PWS, an effective treatment may not be far off. © 2019 World Obesity Federation","hyperphagia; obesity; Prader-Willi syndrome; therapy","Acylation; Adolescent; Animals; Bariatric Surgery; Child; Child, Preschool; Diet Therapy; Female; Ghrelin; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Hyperphagia; Infant; Male; Oxytocin; Pediatric Obesity; Potassium Channels; Prader-Willi Syndrome; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4; antiobesity agent; carbetocin; diazoxide; exendin 4; glwl 01; growth hormone; jd 5037; liraglutide; livoletide; metoprolol; oxytocin; rm 853; setmelanotide; tesofensine; unclassified drug; ghrelin; human growth hormone; MC4R protein, human; melanocortin 4 receptor; potassium channel; appetite; Article; body weight control; diet restriction; human; hyperphagia; obesity; pathogenesis; physical activity; Prader Willi syndrome; acylation; adolescent; animal; bariatric surgery; blood; chemistry; child; childhood obesity; complication; diet therapy; female; hyperphagia; infant; male; pathophysiology; physiology; Prader Willi syndrome; preschool child","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077842745"

The progressively escalating rates of overweight and obesity worldwide have led to an introduction of a new term “globesity”. Excessive accumulation of body fat and especially of visceral adipose tissue is the main predisposing factor for the development of metabolic syndrome and other obesity related co-morbidities. At the present moment only few pharmacotherapeuticals are used for long-term treatment of obesity acting on narrow target spectra, e.g. pancreatic and gastric lipase inhibition, acting as adrenomimetics or activating the satiety centers in hypothalamus. Plant-based medications that accelerate weight loss, proved to be safe, effective and widely available, would be a preferable alternative for anti-obesity treatments. As plant extracts are multi-component systems they could also act by more than one mechanism, including decreased lipid absorption, decreased energy intake, increased energy expenditure, decreased pre-adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, decreased lipogenesis and increased lipolysis. The current review gives a summary of the risk factors for obesity development and its characteristics consequences. Current treatment options, combining lifestyle changes and conventional treatment with commercial anti-obesity drugs have been described as well. Special emphasis on in vitro, in vivo and human studies, of potential medicinal plant extracts and phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, saponins, able to modulate the molecular pathways and gene/protein expressions related to obesity, have been highlighted. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chronic low-grade inflammation; Clinical studies; Contents; Medicinal plants; Novel targets; Obesity; Pharmacotherapy","Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Biomedical Research; Energy Metabolism; Epidemics; Gastric Bypass; Global Health; Homeostasis; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Plant Extracts; Plants, Medicinal; Risk Factors; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; alkaloid derivative; amfebutamone; amphetamine derivative; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; corticosteroid derivative; insulin; liraglutide; lorcaserin; melanocortin 4 receptor; naltrexone; neuroleptic agent; neuropeptide receptor; neuropeptide Y; phentermine; placebo; plant extract; polyphenol derivative; psychotropic agent; rimonabant; saponin derivative; sulfonylurea derivative; terpenoid derivative; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; transcription factor; unindexed drug; plant extract; abdominal pain; Actinidia arguta; acute pancreatitis; amnesia; antiinflammatory activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; bariatric surgery; body mass; body weight gain; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; central nervous system disease; clinical assessment; constipation; depression; diarrhea; drug dependence; drug receptor binding; drug structure; drug targeting; drug tolerance; dyspepsia; environmental factor; enzyme inhibition; flatulence; food intake; gastrointestinal symptom; gene expression; heart palpitation; heart valve regurgitation; heredity; human; hypertension; hypesthesia; hypoglycemia; hypokalemia; in vitro study; in vivo study; lifestyle modification; liver disease; liver failure; liver toxicity; mania; medicinal plant; memory disorder; metabolic regulation; monotherapy; nausea; neuroendocrine disease; neurologic disease; nonhuman; obesity; paresthesia; protein expression; protein synthesis inhibition; pulmonary hypertension; randomized controlled trial (topic); rectum disease; rhinopharyngitis; risk assessment; sedentary lifestyle; seizure; side effect; socioeconomics; structure analysis; suicide attempt; systematic review (topic); tachycardia; teratogenicity; withdrawal syndrome; animal; chemistry; complication; energy metabolism; epidemic; gastric bypass surgery; global health; homeostasis; lifestyle; medical research; obesity; pathophysiology; risk factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052729103"

Our aim was to conduct an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis for all commercially available, evidence-based non-surgical weight loss interventions for people with excess weight. We identified interventions through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that reported weight loss 12 months from baseline. We then meta-analysed the results, sourced costs and performed an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer perspective. Cost-effectiveness was presented in terms of cost per kilogram lost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. We further performed sensitivity analyses on costs and duration of benefits, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Ten interventions were identified for inclusion: six pharmaceutical products (Alli, Xenical, Qsymia, Contrave, Belviq and Saxenda), two lifestyle modification programmes (Weight Watchers Meetings and Online), one food replacement and lifestyle programme (Jenny Craig) and one intragastric balloon system (Orbera). At an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30 071 per additional QALY gained, only Weight Watchers Meetings was cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses revealed that for the medications to become incrementally cost-effective, costs would have to decrease by as much as 91%. Results are highly dependent on duration that benefits are maintained. Despite several newly available interventions, Weight Watchers Meetings is currently the only evidence-based, commercially available, cost-effective option for non-surgical weight loss. Other interventions, specifically medications, are more effective but priced too high to be cost-effective. © 2019 World Obesity Federation","cost-effectiveness; obesity; overweight; weight loss medication; weight loss programmes","amfebutamone plus naltrexone; liraglutide; lorcaserin; phentermine plus topiramate; tetrahydrolipstatin; Article; body weight loss; clinical effectiveness; cost effectiveness analysis; drug cost; evidence based medicine; health care access; human; lifestyle modification; meta analysis; obesity; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; treatment duration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062853065"

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the maintenance of weight loss and immunometabolic health outcomes after diet-induced weight loss followed by 1-year treatment with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide), physical exercise or the combination of both treatments as compared with placebo in individuals with obesity. Methods and analysis This is an investigator-initiated, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. We will enrol expectedly 200 women and men (age 18-65 years) with obesity (body mass index 32-43 kg/m 2) to adhere to a very low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day) for 8 weeks in order to lose at least 5% of body weight. Subsequently, participants will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four study groups for 52 weeks: (1) placebo, (2) exercise 150 min/week+placebo, (3) liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and (4) exercise 150 min/week+liraglutide 3.0 mg/day. The primary endpoint is change in body weight from randomisation to end-of-treatment.

Several anti-obesity medications (AOMs) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use among adult patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2 and at least one obesity-related illness. However, only two FDA-approved AOMs are available for use in children and adolescents, which leads to the frequent off-label use of adult AOMs among this population. We sought to investigate current prescribing patterns of AOMs from school age through to young adulthood in a large unified health system. Using a centralized clinical data registry containing the health data of ~6.5 million patients, individuals aged 5–25 years old with overweight and obesity who were taking one of eight commonly prescribed AOMs from 2009 to 2018 were extracted. A total of 1,720 patients were identified, representing 2,210 medication prescribing instances. The cohort was further stratified as children (5–12 years old), adolescents (13–18 years old), and YA (19–25 years old). The mean BMI at the time of medication initiation was 34.0, 39.1, and 39.6 kg/m2, respectively, which corresponded to a BMI z-score (BMIz) of 2.4 and 2.3 for children and adolescents, respectively. Metformin was the most commonly prescribed medication across all ages, including off-label use for weight-loss among children and adolescents. The most commonly off-label prescribed AOM among YA was topiramate. Multivariable analyses demonstrated phentermine was the most effective AOM, with a 1.54% total body weight among YA (p = 0.05) and a 0.12 decrease in BMIz among adolescents (p = 0.003) greater final weight loss when compared to the respective overall frequency-weighted means. Our study demonstrates a statistically significant weight loss among adolescents and young adults on select pharmacotherapy. The small magnitude of this effect should be interpreted carefully, as it is likely an underestimate in the absence of a true control group. Pharmacotherapy should therefore be considered in conjunction with other multimodal therapies such as lifestyle modification and metabolic and bariatric surgery when treating overweight and obesity. © Copyright © 2020 Czepiel, Perez, Campoverde Reyes, Sabharwal and Stanford.","adolescents; anti-obesity medications; children; obesity; overweight; pharmacotherapy; weight loss medications; young adults","amfebutamone; antiobesity agent; canagliflozin; liraglutide; lorcaserin; metformin; naltrexone; phentermine; pramlintide; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; zonisamide; adolescent; adult; anxiety; Article; body mass; body weight; body weight loss; child; cohort analysis; drug withdrawal; epilepsy; female; gastroesophageal reflux; health care; human; hypertension; intracranial hypertension; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; patient compliance; personality disorder; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; school child; sleep disordered breathing; United States; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085367704"

The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether specific genetic variants in GLP1R or TCF7L2 are associated with delayed GE and weight loss in obese patients treated with liraglutide or the short-acting GLP-1 agonist, exenatide. Methods: We evaluated in obese individuals the associations of genetic variations of GLP1R (rs6923761) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146) on GE T1/2 and weight from two trials that evaluated separately exenatide, 5 μg BID for 30 days, or liraglutide, 3 mg daily for 5 weeks. Data were analyzed using the dominant genetic model and intention-to-treat analysis. Key Results: There was a significant correlation between changes in weight and GE T1/2 (rs = −.382, P =.004). GLP1R rs6923761 minor allele A (AA_AG) carriers who received either exenatide or liraglutide had greater delay in GE T1/2 relative to baseline (117.9 ± 27.5 [SEM] minutes and 128.9 ± 38.32 minutes) compared to GG genotype (95.8 ± 30.4 minutes and 61.4 ± 21.4 minutes, respectively; P =.11). There was a non-significant difference in weight loss based on GLP1R rs6923761 genotype after 5 weeks of treatment. There were no significant correlations with TCF7L2 (rs7903146) genotype. Conclusions & Inferences: The minor A allele of GLP1R (rs6923761) is associated with greater delay in GE T1/2 in response to liraglutide and exenatide. These studies provide data to plan pharmacogenetics testing of the hypothesis that GLP1R (rs6923761) influences weight loss in response to GLP1R agonists. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","gastric emptying; glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; obesity; rs6923761","Adult; Alleles; Double-Blind Method; Exenatide; Female; Gastric Emptying; Genetic Variation; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Pharmacogenetics; Pilot Projects; Weight Loss; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; exendin 4; GLP1R protein, human; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; adult; allele; Article; body weight change; body weight loss; clinical article; cohort analysis; drug effect; female; gene; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic model; genetic variability; genotype; GLP1R gene; human; intention to treat analysis; male; obesity; pharmacogenetics; pilot study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); receptor gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; stomach emptying; TCF7L2 gene; treatment duration; treatment response; allele; controlled study; double blind procedure; genetic variation; genetics; middle aged; pharmacogenetics; physiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; stomach emptying","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042566481"

We previously published a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 16-week trial on effects of once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, liraglutide on weight, satiation, and gastric functions in obese volunteers. The aim of this substudy is to compare to placebo the effects of liraglutide on appetite, taste preference, regional body fat stores, and anthropometric measurements. Methods: Forty obese adults received standard instruction for weight management, monthly behavioral intervention utilizing motivational interviews, and 16-week treatment of once-daily liraglutide (escalated to 3 mg SQ daily). At baseline and 16 weeks, the following were measured: appetite and taste preferences rated every 30 min for 5 h after ingesting 300 mL Ensure®; maximal tolerated volume (MTV) with a nutrient drink test; fasting and postprandial bioactive GLP-1 (7–36) and peptide YY (PYY) levels; total and regional body fat with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and waist and hip circumference. Results: Thirty-five participants (17 liraglutide; 18 placebo) completed the trial. Compared to placebo group, liraglutide group had significant reductions in MTV; prospective food consumption score; desire to eat something sweet, salty, savory or fatty; and an increase in perceived fullness. Postprandial plasma levels of GLP-1 decreased and PYY levels increased with liraglutide relative to baseline. Significant reductions in total body, trunk, and upper and lower body fat without reduction in lean body mass were observed. Conclusion: Liraglutide 3 mg SQ modulates appetite, taste preference, gut hormones, and regional body fat stores in adults with obesity without reduction in lean body mass. © Endocrine Society 2019.

Liraglutide (LRG), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, can reduce body weight. This study assessed the metabolic efficacy of LRG in real-world clinical practice. Methods: An observational, retrospective cohort study including patients treated with LRG for at least one year (187 patients). Anthropometric and metabolic variables, a composite endpoint, factors predicting response to LRG, and cardiovascular risk over time were assessed. A linear mixed-effects model with a bivariate structure was constructed to investigate the time-dependent relationship between weight and HbA1c values. Results: HbA1c levels and weight significantly decreased in the first 12 weeks, and the decrease persisted at 12 and 24 months in all subgroups studied. Mean weight and HbA1c decreases after 24 months were 8.5 kg and 1.7% respectively. HbA1c values <7% were achieved by 42% of patients at 12 months and by 40% at 24 months. Treatment with LRG allowed for reduction in insulin dose. No serious adverse events were noted. Cardiovascular risk decreased from high to moderate-low. Conclusions: Under standard clinical practice conditions, LRG achieved a better metabolic response than seen in clinical trials. Efficacy at 12 weeks of treatment is a good predictor of response. LRG allows for delaying or reducing insulin dose by improving both weight and glucose control.

Preclinical evidence in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease suggests that liraglutide exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing amyloid oligomers, normalising synaptic plasticity and cerebral glucose uptake, and increasing the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the change in cerebral glucose metabolic rate after 12 months of treatment with liraglutide in participants with Alzheimer's disease compared to those who are receiving placebo. Methods/design: ELAD is a 12-month, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb trial of liraglutide in participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia. A total of 206 participants will be randomised to receive either liraglutide or placebo as a daily injection for a year. The primary outcome will be the change in cerebral glucose metabolic rate in the cortical regions (hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, and posterior cingulate) from baseline to follow-up in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. The key secondary outcomes are the change from baseline to 12 months in z scores for clinical and cognitive measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale and Executive domain scores of the Neuropsychological Test Battery, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living) and the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically important changes in safety assessments. Other secondary outcomes are 12-month change in magnetic resonance imaging volume, diffusion tensor imaging parameters, reduction in microglial activation in a subgroup of participants, reduction in tau formation and change in amyloid levels in a subgroup of participants measured by tau and amyloid imaging, and changes in composite scores using support machine vector analysis in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. Discussion: Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide. As available treatments are only symptomatic, the search for disease-modifying therapies is a priority. If the ELAD trial is successful, liraglutide and GLP-1 analogues will represent an important class of compounds to be further evaluated in clinical trials for Alzheimer's treatment.

Methods: A Medline and Embase search for “exenatide” OR “liraglutide” OR “albiglutide” OR “dulaglutide” OR “lixisenatide” was performed, collecting randomized clinical trials (duration > 12 weeks) up to September 2016, comparing GLP-1 RA at the maximal approved dose with placebo or active drugs. Furthermore, unpublished studies were searched in the www.clinicaltrials.gov register. For meta-analyses, the outcome considered were 24- and 52-week HbA1c. Separate analyses were performed, whenever possible, for subgroups of trials based on several inclusion criteria. In addition, meta-regression analyses were performed for comparisons for which 10 or more trails were available. Results: A total of 92 trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria were identified. In placebo-controlled trials (n = 41), the 24-week mean reduction of HbA1c with GLP-1 RA was − 0.75 [− 0.87; − 0.63]%. Shorter-acting molecules appear to be more effective in patients with lower fasting glucose, whereas longer-acting agents in patients with higher fasting hyperglycaemia. Obesity and duration of diabetes do not seem to moderate the efficacy of GLP-1 RA, whereas in non-Caucasians and older patients liraglutide could be less effective. At 52 weeks, only 9 placebo-controlled trials were available for preventing any reliable analyses. Conclusions: Using a variety of approaches (meta-analyses of subgroup of trials, meta-regression, systematic review of subgroup analyses in individual trials, and meta-analyses of subgroups of patients), we identified some putative predictors of efficacy of GLP-1 RA, which deserve further investigation. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l.","Incretins; Systematic review; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Biomarkers, Pharmacological; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Glucagon-Like Peptides; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments; Liraglutide; Peptides; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Venoms; albiglutide; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; lixisenatide; antidiabetic agent; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glycosylated hemoglobin; hybrid protein; immunoglobulin Fc fragment; liraglutide; lixisenatide; peptide; pharmacological biomarker; rGLP-1 protein; venom; age; Article; data extraction; diabetes mellitus; disease duration; drug efficacy; ethnicity; glucose blood level; human; hyperglycemia; meta analysis (topic); obesity; priority journal; systematic review; agonists; analogs and derivatives; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; randomized controlled trial (topic); statistics and numerical data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029601003"

At present, only the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have demonstrated macrovascular benefits and reduction in mortality in T2D. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the more than 20 drug classes in clinical development for T2D, with an outline of their mode of action, efficacy, safety, and current status. Expert opinion: New GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i are dominating the clinical pipeline. A range of glucoregulatory hormone-based drugs are also under development (e.g. GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon receptor co-agonists) for the treatment of T2D and associated conditions such as obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Glucokinase activators and imeglimin are in phase III of development. Other drugs in phase I–II (e.g. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase inhibitors, activators of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and Lyn kinase; and agonists of the receptor for growth differentiation factor 15, fibroblast growth factor-21, and G protein-coupled receptor-119) show promising diverse mechanisms of action, but have yet to show net clinical benefits. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Antidiabetic; development; diabetes treatment; pipeline; type 2 diabetes (T2D)","Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Development; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; 6,7 dihydro 4 hydroxy 3 (2' hydroxy 1,1' biphenyl 4 yl) 6 oxothieno[2,3 b]pyridine 5 carbonitrile; activin receptor 2; albiglutide; amylin receptor; antidiabetic agent; bimagrumab; calcitonin receptor; da 1241; dulaglutide; exendin 4; fibroblast growth factor 21; fleroxacin; fructose bisphosphatase; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucagon receptor antagonist; glucokinase; growth differentiation factor 15; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase activator; imeglimin; kbp 042; kbp 089; liraglutide; lixisenatide; mbx 2982; o 304; pramlintide; protein kinase Lyn; pxl 770; semaglutide; tmg 123; tolimidone; ttp 399; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; acne; acute pancreatitis; anorexia; Article; chemical structure; coughing; diarrhea; drug effect; drug structure; dyslipidemia; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; human; hypoglycemia; muscle spasm; muscle weakness; musculoskeletal stiffness; myalgia; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pharmaceutical care; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; somnolence; vomiting; animal; drug development; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; pharmacology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087802968"

The efficacy, however, of the specific approach has never been evaluated in a randomized trial, as described here. The 1-year trial also assessed whether the addition to IBT of liraglutide 3.0 mg would significantly increase weight loss and whether the provision of meal replacements would add further benefit. Methods: A total of 150 adults with obesity were randomly assigned to: IBT (IBT-alone), providing 21 counseling visits; IBT combined with liraglutide (IBT-liraglutide); or IBT-liraglutide combined for 12 weeks with a 1,000- to 1,200-kcal/d meal-replacement diet (Multicomponent). All participants received weekly IBT visits in month 1, every-other-week visits in months 2 to 6, and monthly sessions thereafter. Results: Ninety-one percent of participants completed 1 year, at which time mean (± SEM) losses for IBT-alone, IBT-liraglutide, and Muticomponent participants were 6.1 ± 1.3%, 11.5 ± 1.3%, and 11.8 ± 1.3% of baseline weight, respectively. Fully 44.0%, 70.0%, and 74.0% of these participants lost ≥ 5% of weight, respectively. The liraglutide-treated groups were superior to IBT-alone on both outcomes. Weight loss in all three groups was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate the efficacy of IBT for obesity and the potential benefit of adding pharmacotherapy to this approach. © 2018 The Obesity Society","","Aged; Behavior Therapy; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Treatment Outcome; liraglutide; placebo; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; adult; Article; asthma; behavior therapy; bile duct stone; body weight loss; caloric restriction; cardiometabolic risk; clinical effectiveness; constipation; controlled study; female; gastroenteritis; human; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; nausea; obesity; open study; parallel design; patient counseling; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; treatment duration; treatment outcome; upper respiratory tract infection; wound infection; aged; behavior therapy; middle aged; obesity; procedures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056468181"

In a randomized trial, we previously demonstrated that 16 weeks of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide treatment vs. placebo significantly reduced glucometabolic disturbances and body weight in prediabetic, overweight/obese schizophrenia-spectrum disorder patients treated with clozapine or olanzapine. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the beneficial effects of the 16-week intervention were sustained beyond the intervention period. Method: One year after completion of the intervention, we investigated changes in body weight, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, C-peptide, and lipids comparing 1-year follow-up levels to end of treatment (week 16) and baseline (week 0) levels. Results: From end of treatment to the 1-year follow-up, body weight had increased in the liraglutide-treated group. However, compared to baseline levels, the placebo-subtracted body weight loss remained significantly reduced (−3.8 kg, 95% CI: −7.3 to −0.2, P = 0.04). Fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, C-peptide, and lipids had each returned to baseline levels 1 year after stopping liraglutide. Conclusion: The body weight reduction during 16 weeks of liraglutide treatment was partially sustained 1 year after the intervention was completed. However, the improvements in other metabolic parameters returned to baseline levels. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Therefore, study objectives were to understand how pediatric gastroenterologists in the US approach the management of NAFLD, and to identify barriers to care for children with NAFLD.Methods:We performed structured one-on-one interviews to ascertain each individual pediatric gastroenterologist's approach to the management of NAFLD in children. Responses were recorded from open-ended questions regarding screening for comorbidities, recommendations regarding nutrition, physical activity, medications, and perceived barriers to care.Results:Response rate was 72.0% (486/675). Mean number of patients examined per week was 3 (standard deviation [SD] 3.5). Dietary intervention was recommended by 98.4% of pediatric gastroenterologists. Notably, 18 different dietary recommendations were reported. A majority of physicians provided targets for exercise frequency (72.6%, mean 5.6 days/wk, SD 1.6) and duration (69.9%, mean 40.2 minutes/session, SD 16.4). Medications were prescribed by 50.6%. Almost one-half of physicians (47.5%) screened for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Providers who spent more than 25 minutes at the initial visit were more likely to screen for comorbidities (P = 0.003). Barriers to care were reported by 92.8% with 29.0% reporting ≥3 barriers.Conclusions:The majority of US pediatric gastroenterologists regularly encounter children with NAFLD. Varied recommendations regarding diet and exercise highlight the need for prospective clinical trials. NAFLD requires a multidimensional approach with adequate resources in the home, community, and clinical setting. © ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN.

The epidemiology, pathophysiology, developmental considerations, and response to therapy in pediatric-onset diabetes are different from adult diabetes. There are also differences in recommended care for children and adolescents with type 1 as opposed to type 2 diabetes. This section first add resses care for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and next addresses care for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Figure 13.1 provides guidance on managing new-onset diabetes in youth with overweight or obesity before type 1 or type 2 diabetes is diagnosed and so applies to all youth with overweight or obesity. Lastly, guidance is provided in this section on transition of care from pediatric to adult providers to ensure that the continuum of care is appropriate as the child with diabetes develops into adulthood. Due to the nature of clinical research in children, the recommendations for children and adolescents with diabetes are less likely to be based on clinical trial evidence. However, expert opinion and a review of available and relevant experimental data are summarized in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statements “Type 1 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents” (1) and “Evaluation and Management of Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes” (2).

However, the effects of OXM on glucose homeostasis remain ill defined. To address this gap, we evaluated the effects of an i.v. infusion of native OXM on insulin secretion rates (ISRs) and glycemic excursion in a graded glucose infusion (GGI) procedure in two separate randomized, placebo (PBO)-controlled, single-dose crossover trials in 12 overweight and obese subjects without diabetes and in 12 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using the GLP-1 analog liraglutide (LIRA) as a comparator in T2DM. In both groups, in the GGI, 3.0 pmol/kg/min of OXM significantly increased ISR and blunted glycemic excursion relative to PBO. In T2DM, the effects of OXM were comparable to those of LIRA, including restoration of b-cell glucose responsiveness to that of nonobese subjects without diabetes. Our findings indicate that native OXM significantly augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion acutely in obese subjects with and without diabetes, with effects comparable to pharmacologic GLP-1 receptor activation and independent of weight loss. Native OXM has potential to improve hyperglycemia via complementary and independent induction of insulin secretion and weight loss. © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adult; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Glucose; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Infusions, Intravenous; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Male; Obesity; Overweight; Oxyntomodulin; Receptors, Glucagon; Young Adult; liraglutide; oxyntomodulin; placebo; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; GLP1R protein, human; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucagon receptor; glucose; insulin; oxyntomodulin; adult; Article; body weight loss; clinical article; continuous infusion; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; glucose homeostasis; glucose infusion; human; hyperglycemia; insulin release; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; agonists; blood; body mass; chemically induced; clinical trial; cohort analysis; comparative study; complication; dose response; drug effect; hyperglycemia; intravenous drug administration; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; secretion (process); young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047775153"

Recent data from cardiovascular outcomes trials for the GLP-1R agonists, liraglutide and semaglutide, have also demonstrated significant reductions in death rates from cardiovascular causes in patients with T2D. As cardiovascular death is the number one cause of death in patients with T2D, understanding the mechanisms by which GLP-1R agonists such as liraglutide and semaglutide improve cardiac function is essential. Yet despite strong evidence from preclinical and clinical studies supporting the cardioprotective actions of GLP-1R agonists, the precise mechanism(s) by which this drug-class for T2D may produce these beneficial actions remains enigmatic. Negligible GLP-1R expression in ventricular cardiac myocytes suggests that GLP-1R agonist-induced cardioprotection is likely partially attributed to indirect actions on peripheral tissues other than the heart. Because insulin increases glucose oxidation, whereas glucagon increases fatty acid oxidation in the heart, GLP-1R agonist-induced increases and decreases in insulin and glucagon secretion, respectively, may modify cardiac energy metabolism in T2D patients. This may represent a potential mechanism for GLP-1R agonist-induced cardioprotection in T2D, as increases in fatty acid oxidation and decreases in glucose oxidation are frequently observed in the hearts of animals and human subjects with T2D. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Energy metabolism; Fatty acid oxidation; Glucagon; Glucagon-like peptide-1; Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor; Glucose oxidation; Heart; Insulin","Animals; Cardiovascular System; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Glucagon; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Glucose; Humans; Insulin; Myocardium; Oxidation-Reduction; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; incretin; insulin; fatty acid; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucose; Article; cardiac energy metabolism; cardiac muscle cell; energy metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; glucagon release; glucose oxidation; heart; heart protection; human; insulin release; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; systemic therapy; agonists; animal; cardiac muscle; cardiovascular system; energy metabolism; genetics; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oxidation reduction reaction; pathology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041479468"

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subtype of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has also augmented considerably being currently cirrhosis due to NASH the second indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Innovative treatments for NASH have shown promising results in phase 2 studies and are being presently evaluated in phase 3 trials. On the other hand, the high mortality on the liver transplant waitlist and the organ shortage has obligated the transplant centers to consider suboptimal grafts, such as steatotic livers for transplantation. Fatty livers are vulnerable to preservation injury resulting in a higher rate of primary nonfunction, early allograft dysfunction and posttransplant vascular and biliary complications. Macrosteatosis of more than 30% in fact is an independent risk factor for graft loss. Therefore, it needs to be considered into the risk assessment scores. Growing evidence supports that moderate and severe macrosteatotic grafts can be successfully used for liver transplantation with careful recipient selection. Protective strategies, such as machine-based perfusion have been developed in experimental setting to minimize preservation-related injury and are now on the verge to move into the clinical implementation. This review focuses on the current and potential future treatment of NASH and the clinical practice in fatty liver transplantation, highlights its limitations and optimal allocation, and summarizes the advances of experimental protective strategies, and their potential for clinical application to increase the acceptance and improve the outcomes after liver transplantation with high-grade steatotic livers. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Midregional-pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midregional-pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and copeptin are all associated with CVD and part of the delicate system controlling fluid and hemodynamic homeostasis through vascular tonus and diuresis. The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D including a decrease in particular MR-proANP. Objective: To investigate if treatment with liraglutide in women with PCOS reduces levels of the cardiovascular biomarkers MR-proADM, MR-proANP and copeptin. Methods: Seventy-two overweight women with PCOS were treated with 1.8 mg/ day liraglutide or placebo for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled RCT. Biomarkers, anthropometrics, insulin resistance, body composition (DXA) and visceral fat (MRI) were examined. Results: Baseline median (IQR) levels were as follows: MR-proADM 0.52 (0.45-0.56) nmol/L, MR-proANP 44.8 (34.6-56.7) pmol/L and copeptin 4.95 (3.50-6.50) pmol/L. Mean percentage differences (95% CI) between liraglutide and placebo group after treatment were as follows: MR-proADM −6% (−11 to 2, P = 0.058), MR-proANP −25% (−37 to −11, P = 0.001) and copeptin +4% (−13 to 25, P = 0.64). Reduction in MR-proANP concentration correlated with both increased heart rate and diastolic blood pressure in the liraglutide group. Multiple regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, free testosterone, insulin resistance, visceral fat, heart rate and eGFR showed reductions in MR-proANP to be independently correlated with an increase in the heart rate. Conclusion: In an RCT, liraglutide treatment in women with PCOS reduced levels of the cardiovascular risk biomarkers MR-proANP with 25% and MR-proADM with 6% (borderline significance) compared with placebo. The decrease in MR-proANP was independently associated with an increase in the heart rate. © 2018 The authors.","Adrenomedullin; Atrial natriuretic peptide; Copeptin; GLP-1 receptor agonist; PCOS","adrenomedullin; atrial natriuretic factor; copeptin; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; placebo; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; triacylglycerol; adult; Article; biochemical analysis; blood analysis; blood pressure; body composition; body weight; chemiluminescence immunoassay; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug effect; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; heart rate; homeostasis model assessment; human; immunofluorescence test; insulin resistance; intraperitoneal fat; major clinical study; mass spectrometry; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; ovary polycystic disease; priority journal; protein expression; randomized controlled trial; subcutaneous fat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040243548"

However, their actions in the CNS have not yet been studied in the human brain after longer-term administration at the highest dose approved for obesity (liraglutide 3.0 mg). Materials and Methods: A total of 20 participants with obesity were treated with placebo and liraglutide (3.0 mg) in the context of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial after 5 weeks of dose escalation. Neurocognitive and neuroimaging (fMRI) responses to food cues were examined at the clinical research center of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Results: While using liraglutide, patients lost more weight (placebo-subtracted −2.7%; P <.001), had decreased fasting glucose (P <.001) and showed improved cholesterol levels. In an uncontrolled analysis, brain activation in response to food images was not altered by liraglutide vs placebo. When controlled for BMI/weight, liraglutide increased activation of the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to food cues (P <.016, corrected for multiple comparisons). Conclusions: In contrast to prior studies, we demonstrate for the first time that liraglutide treatment, administered over a longer period at the highest doses approved for obesity, does not alter brain activation in response to food cues. A counter-regulatory increase in reward-related OFC activation in response to food cues can be observed when neuroimaging data are controlled for BMI changes, indicating changes in CNS that could lead to later plateaus of weight loss. These data point to a promising focus for additional interventions which, by contributing to the CNS reward system, could provide tangible benefits in reversing the plateauing phenomenon and promoting further weight loss.

To conduct a single-centre, double-blind, 12-week trial comparing the effect of 0.6 mg liraglutide and steady-state liraglutide 3.0 mg with placebo on gallbladder emptying in adults with body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2 and without diabetes. Methods: Participants were randomized 1:1 to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (n = 26) or placebo (n = 26), starting at 0.6 mg with 0.6-mg weekly increments to 3.0 mg, with nutritional and physical activity counselling. A 600-kcal (23.7 g fat) liquid meal test was performed at baseline, after the first dose and after 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the 12-week maximum postprandial gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEFmax), measured over 240 minutes after starting the meal. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (mean ± SD overall age 47.6 ± 10.0 years, BMI 32.6 ±3.4 kg/m2, 50% women). Mean 12-week GBEFmax (treatment difference −3.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] −13.1, 5.7) and area under the GBEF curve in the first 60 minutes (−390% × min, 95% CI −919, 140) did not differ for liraglutide 3.0 mg (n = 23) vs placebo (n = 24). The median (range) time to GBEFmax was 151 (11-240) minutes with liraglutide 3.0 mg and 77 (22-212) minutes with placebo. Similar findings were noted after the first 0.6-mg liraglutide dose. Gastrointestinal disorders, notably nausea and constipation, were the most frequently reported adverse events. Conclusions: Treatment with liraglutide did not affect the GBEFmax but appeared to prolong the time to GBEFmax. © 2018 The Authors.

METHODS Male wild-type C57BL/6J mice (DIO-NASH) and Lepob/ob (ob/ob -NASH) mice were fed a diet high in trans-fat (40%), fructose (20%) and cholesterol (2%) for 30 and 21 wk, respectively. Prior to treatment, all mice underwent liver biopsy for confirmation and stratification of liver steatosis and fibrosis, using the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis staging system. The mice were kept on the diet and received vehicle, liraglutide (0.2 mg/kg, SC, BID), obeticholic acid (OCA, 30 mg/kg PO, QD), or elafibranor (30 mg/kg PO, QD) for eight weeks. Within-subject comparisons were performed on changes in steatosis, inflammation, ballooning degeneration, and fibrosis scores. In addition, compound effects were evaluated by quantitative liver histology, including percent fractional area of liver fat, galectin-3, and collagen 1a1. RESULTS Liraglutide and elafibranor, but not OCA, reduced body weight in both models. Liraglutide improved steatosis scores in DIO-NASH mice only. Elafibranor and OCA reduced histopathological scores of hepatic steatosis and inflammation in both models, but only elafibranor reduced fibrosis severity. Liraglutide and OCA reduced total liver fat, collagen 1a1, and galectin-3 content, driven by significant reductions in liver weight. The individual drug effects on NASH histological endpoints were supported by global gene expression (RNA sequencing) and liver lipid biochemistry. CONCLUSION DIO-NASH and ob/ob -NASH mouse models show distinct treatment effects of liraglutide, OCA, and elafibranor, being in general agreement with corresponding findings in clinical trials for NASH. The present data therefore further supports the clinical translatability and utility of DIO-NASH and ob/ob -NASH mouse models of NASH for probing the therapeutic efficacy of compounds in preclinical drug development for NASH. © The Author(s) 2018.

The present multisite study provides the first evaluation, in primary care, of the effect of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services–based IBT benefit, delivered alone (with placebo) or in combination with liraglutide 3.0 mg. Methods: The Satiety and Clinical Adiposity—Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) IBT was a 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in individuals with obesity who received liraglutide 3.0 mg (n = 142) or placebo (n = 140) as an adjunct to IBT. Results: At week 56, mean weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg plus IBT was 7.5% and 4.0% with placebo combined with IBT (estimated treatment difference [95% CI]–3.4% [–5.3% to –1.6%], P = 0.0003). Significantly more individuals on liraglutide 3.0 mg than placebo achieved ≥ 5% weight loss (61.5% vs. 38.8%; odds ratio [OR] 2.5% [1.5% to 4.1%], P = 0.0003), > 10% weight loss (30.5% vs. 19.8%; OR 1.8% [1.0% to 3.1%], P = 0.0469), and > 15% weight loss (18.1% vs. 8.9%; OR 2.3% [1.1% to 4.7%], P = 0.0311). Liraglutide 3.0 mg in combination with IBT was well tolerated, with no new safety signals identified. Conclusions: In a primary care setting, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services–based IBT produced clinically meaningful weight loss at 56 weeks, enhanced by the addition of liraglutide 3.0 mg. © 2020 The Authors.

A reduction of hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) by pioglitazone or caloric restriction is accompanied by a decrease in circulating CETP. Since GLP-1 analogues also reduce HTGC, we assessed whether liraglutide decreases CETP. Furthermore, we investigated the association between HTGC and CETP in a population-based cohort. In a placebo-controlled trial, 50 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to treatment with liraglutide or placebo added to standard care. In this trial and in 1,611 participants of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study, we measured HTGC and circulating CETP by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ELISA, respectively. The HTGC was decreased in the liraglutide group (−6.3%; 95%CI of difference [−9.5, −3.0]) but also in the placebo group (−4.0%; 95%CI[−6.0, −2.0]), without between-group differences. CETP was not decreased by liraglutide (−0.05 µg/mL; 95%CI[−0.13, 0.04]) or placebo (−0.04 µg/mL; 95%CI[−0.12, 0.04]). No association was present between HTGC and CETP at baseline (β: 0.002 µg/mL per %TG, 95%CI[−0.005, 0.009]) and between the changes after treatment with liraglutide (β: 0.003 µg/mL per %TG, 95%CI[−0.010, 0.017]) or placebo (β: 0.006 µg/mL per %TG, 95%CI[−0.012,0.024]). Also, in the cohort n o association between HTGC and CETP was present (β: −0.001 µg/mL per SD TG, 95%CI[−0.005, 0.003]). A reduction of HTGC after treatment with liraglutide or placebo does not decrease circulating CETP. Also, no association between HTGC and CETP was present in a large cohort. These findings indicate that circulating CETP is not determined by HTGC.

Although lifestyle interventions can support people with SMI to lose weight, some are unable to make the necessary lifestyle changes or, despite making the changes, continue to gain weight. Objective: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a full-scale trial evaluating whether liraglutide 3.0 mg, a once-daily injectable therapy, may be an effective treatment of overweight and obesity in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and first-episode psychosis. Methods: Design: a single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: mental health facilities within Southern Health NHS Trust. Participants: 60 adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or first-episode psychosis prescribed antipsychotic medication will be recruited. Participants will be overweight or obese, defined by their baseline BMI which will be: •BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or •BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2 in the presence of at least one weight-related consequence. This is in concordance with the current EU licence for liraglutide (maximum dosage 3.0 mg). Intervention: participants will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-based randomisation programme to either once-daily subcutaneously administered liraglutide or placebo, titrated to 3.0 mg daily, for 6 months. All participants will receive standardised written information about healthy eating and exercise at their randomisation visit. Outcomes: the main aim of the study is to gather data on recruitment, consent, retention and adherence. Qualitative interviews with a purposive sub-sample of participants and healthcare workers will provide data on intervention feasibility and acceptability. Secondary clinical outcome measurements will be assessed at 3 and 6 months and will include: weight, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, HbA1c level; and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Discussion: This study should provide evidence of the potential benefits of liraglutide (maximum dosage 3.0 mg daily) on body weight and metabolic variables in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and first-episode psychosis. It will also address the feasibility and acceptability of the use of liraglutide in mental health settings. This will inform the design of a longer outcome study that will be needed to determine whether any weight loss can be maintained in the long term.

While there are no approved drugs for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, strategies to ameliorate fatty liver often target these related diseases. We sought to determine if any medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat diabetes are helpful in reducing weight and improving steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of published and unpublished studies evaluating the comparative effectiveness and harms of diabetes medications for the treatment of NAFLD. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through 3rd quarter, 2019 using terms for included drugs and indications. Results: We screened 1591 citations and included 18 trials of diabetes drugs to treat NAFLD. Studies of metformin found no difference from placebo in steatosis, fibrosis, NAFLD activity score, or resolution of NASH. While weight and glucose control were improved with metformin, it did not substantially impact liver disease. Studies of pioglitazone in NASH patients found benefits in liver function, liver fat, and NASH resolution, though significant increases in weight may be cause for concern. Evidence for other thiazolinediones was more limited and had somewhat mixed results, but findings were generally consistent with those for pioglitazone: liver fat and function and glucose measures improved, but weight also increased. We found some evidence that liraglutide improves liver fat, liver function, and HbA1c and is effective at resolving NASH and reducing weight. Exenatide performed less well but also resulted in significant reductions in liver fat and weight. Conclusions: Consistent with existing clinical practice guidelines, which recommend lifestyle intervention and treatment for comorbidities related to fatty liver disease as first-line treatment, trial evidence supports the efficacy of some diabetes drugs (especially pioglitazone) in patients with NAFLD or NASH, though weight gain with some diabetes drugs may warrant caution. Larger trials are needed to better characterize the efficacy and harms of diabetes pharmacotherapy in these patients. © 2019 The Author(s).","Diabetes; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; Pharmacotherapy; Systematic review","Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Exenatide; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Metformin; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Pioglitazone; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Rosiglitazone; cenicriviroc; elafibranor; exendin 4; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; metformin; metformin plus rosiglitazone; pentoxifylline; pioglitazone; placebo; rosiglitazone; selonsertib; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; exendin 4; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; liraglutide; metformin; pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; Article; body weight loss; Cochrane Library; comparative effectiveness; diabetes mellitus; drug withdrawal; Embase; gastrointestinal disease; human; liver function; Medline; nonalcoholic fatty liver; Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score; practice guideline; priority journal; systematic review; body weight; drug effect; glucose blood level; metabolism; nonalcoholic fatty liver; pathology; pathophysiology; randomized controlled trial (topic)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075780213"

Insulin resistance appears to be the major contributor. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, improves peripheral glucose disposal and reduces body weight. We evaluated whether liraglutide in combination with metformin (MET-LIRA) is more effective than metformin monotherapy (MET-P) in improving insulin action and reducing body weight in overweight prior GDM (pGDM) women. Methods: Women (n = 153; body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2; 18–45 y; GDM within 12 months) with metabolic abnormalities were randomized to MET-LIRA (MET-2000 mg, LIRA 1.8 mg SC QD) or MET-P (MET-2000 mg, Placebo QD). Study visits at baseline, 36–40, 56–60 and 80–84 weeks included body weight (BW), BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio measures. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed to assess glycemia, mean blood glucose (MBG), lipids, and compute insulin sensitivity and secretion measures. Findings: Seventy-two (47%) participants completed the study. MET-LIRA therapy was significantly better in improving MBG and insulin sensitivity indices [SIOGTT MET-LIRA from 4.6 (3.2) to 5.9 (2.9) vs. MET-P 5.5 (3.0) to 5.4 (3.2)] and reducing BW and central adiposity [BMI MET-LIRA from 37.2 (8.3) to 33.8 (5.2) vs MET-P 33.8(5.2) to 32.8(6)]. MET–LIRA therapy but not MET-P decreased triglycerides (TRG) and TRG/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratios. Interpretation: MET-LIRA treatment demonstrated superior efficacy in correcting the metabolic status of pGDM women over 84 weeks of therapy. The addition of liraglutide to metformin therapy resulted in a more dramatic decrease in BW and central adiposity than metformin alone.

This research examined the microvascular actions of the GLP-1 analogues liraglutide and exenatide in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (study 1). It also explored the involvement of the GLP-1 receptor (study 2) and the nitric oxide pathway in mediating the microvascular effects of the analogues. Methods: Trial design: Studies 1 and 2 had a randomised, controlled, double-blind study design. Study 1 participants, intervention and methods: three participant groups were recruited: individuals with well-controlled type 2 diabetes, and obese and lean individuals without diabetes (21 participants per group). Liraglutide (0.06 mg), exenatide (0.5 μg) and saline (154 mmol/l NaCl; 0.9%) control were microinjected into separate sites in the dermis (forearm) in a randomised order, blinded to operator and participant. Skin microvascular perfusion was assessed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging. Outcomes were stabilised response (mean skin perfusion between 7.5 and 10 min post microinjection) and total response (AUC, normalised for baseline perfusion). Perfusion response to GLP-1 analogues was compared with saline within each group as well as between groups. Study 2 participants, intervention and methods: in healthy individuals (N = 16), liraglutide (0.06 mg) and saline microinjected sites were pretreated with saline or the GLP-1 receptor blocker, exendin-(9,39), in a randomised order, blinded to participant and operator. Outcomes were as above (stabilised response and total perfusion response). Perfusion response to liraglutide was compared between the saline and the exendin-(9,39) pretreated sites. In vitro study: the effects of liraglutide and exenatide on nitrate levels and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation (activation) were examined using human microvascular endothelial cells. Results: Study 1 results: both analogues increased skin perfusion (stabilised response and total response) in all groups (n = 21 per group, p < 0.001), with the microvascular responses similar across groups (p ≥ 0.389). Study 2 results: liraglutide response (stabilised response and total response) was not influenced by pretreatment with exendin-(9,39) (70 nmol/l) (N = 15, one dataset excluded) (p ≥ 0.609). Liraglutide and exenatide increased nitrate production and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation (p ≤ 0.020).

The high prevalence of obesity generates a justified need to identify cost-effective weight loss approaches from a payer’s perspective. Within the variety of weight management techniques, OPTIFAST is a clinically recognized and scientifically proven total meal replacement Low Calorie Diet that provides meaningful results in terms of weight loss and reduction in comorbidities. The objective of this study is assess potential cost-savings of the OPTIFAST program in the US, as compared to “no intervention” and pharmacotherapy. Methods: An event-driven decision analytic model was used to estimate payer’s cost-savings from reimbursement of the 1-year OPTIFAST program over 3 years in the US. The analysis was performed for the broad population of obese persons (BMI >30 kg/m2) undergoing the OPTIFAST program vs liraglutide 3 mg, naltrexone/bupropion and vs “no intervention”. The model included the risk of complications related to increased BMI. Data sources included published literature, clinical trials, official US price/tariff lists, and national population statistics. The primary perspective was that of a US payer; costs were provided in 2016 US dollars. Results: OPTIFAST leads over a period of 3 years to cost-savings of USD 9,285 per class I and II obese patient (BMI 30–39.9 kg/m2) as compared to liraglutide and USD 685 as compared to naltrexone/bupropion. In the same time perspective, the OPTIFAST program leads to a reduction of cost of obesity complications of USD 1,951 as compared to “no intervention”, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD 6,475 per QALY. Scenario analyses also show substantial cost-savings in patients with class III obesity (BMI ≥ 40.0 kg/m2) and patients with obesity (BMI = 30–39.9 kg/m2) and type 2 diabetes vs all three previous comparators and bariatric surgery. Conclusions: Reimbursing OPTIFAST leads to meaningful cost-savings for US payers as compared with “no intervention” and liraglutide and naltrexone/bupropion in obese patients. Similar results can be expected in matching healthcare settings of other countries. Moreover, OPTIFAST has additional clinical and economic advantages through very low complication and adverse events rates. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","health economics; model; Obesity; Optifast; payer","Bariatric Surgery; Body Mass Index; Bupropion; Caloric Restriction; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Combinations; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Models, Economic; Naltrexone; Obesity; Overweight; United States; Weight Loss; Weight Reduction Programs; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; liraglutide; nutrition supplement; optifast; amfebutamone; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; naltrexone; Naltrexone-Bupropion combination; Article; bariatric surgery; behavior modification; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; decision tree; diarrhea; diet restriction; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug safety; dyspepsia; female; headache; health care cost; health economics; heart infarction; human; incidence; low calory diet; major clinical study; male; morbid obesity; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; probability; randomized controlled trial (topic); reimbursement; remission; risk factor; treatment outcome; United States; vomiting; weight loss program; body weight loss; caloric restriction; complication; cost benefit analysis; diet therapy; drug combination; economic model; economics; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; procedures; weight loss program","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047137484"

Anti-obesity medications (AOMs) are available to treat obesity and can produce clinically meaningful weight loss but do not address associated psychological issues. We evaluated the usefulness and acceptability of an adjunct online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme for improving psychological outcomes. Method: We conducted a real-world 26-week observational study of 120 adults attending an obesity clinic who undertook a comprehensive weight management programme that included standard diet and exercise interventions, an AOM and an online 10-module CBT intervention. Baseline and 26-week psychological, metabolic and physical measures were compared. Results: At 26 weeks, depression, anxiety, stress and emotional eating levels for the sample decreased significantly compared to baseline (all p <.01). Satisfaction and acceptability were highly rated. The mean weight loss was 8.13 ± 3.83%. Mean waist circumference reduction was 7.62 ± 3.4 cm. Discussion: Online CBT has the potential to be a useful adjunct to AOMs and lifestyle interventions for providing psychological support as shown by improvement in mental health, emotional eating and acceptability scales.

Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of switching from sitagliptin to liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK. Materials and Methods: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model Version 8.5+ was used to project costs and clinical outcomes over patients' lifetimes. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were derived from the LIRA-SWITCH trial. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. Costs were accounted in pounds sterling (GBP) and expressed in 2016 values. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Model projections showed improved quality-adjusted life expectancy for patients with poorly controlled HbA1c upon switching from sitagliptin to liraglutide, compared with continuing sitagliptin treatment (9.18 vs 9.02 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). Treatment switching was associated with increased overall costs (GBP 24737 vs GBP 22362). Higher pharmacy costs were partially offset by reduced diabetes-related complication costs in patients who switched to liraglutide. Switching to liraglutide was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 15423 per QALY gained vs continuing with sitagliptin treatment. Conclusions: Switching from sitagliptin 100 mg to liraglutide 1.8 mg in patients with poor glycaemic control was projected to improve clinical outcomes and is likely to be considered cost-effective in the UK setting and, therefore, a good use of limited NHS resources. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","cost-effectiveness; GLP-1 analogue; incretin therapy; liraglutide, sitagliptin; type 2 diabetes","Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Drug Monitoring; Drug Resistance; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Health Care Costs; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Models, Economic; Overweight; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Sitagliptin Phosphate; United Kingdom; Weight Loss; hemoglobin A1c; isophane insulin; liraglutide; metformin; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; GLP1R protein, human; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; sitagliptin; adult; Article; body mass; body weight; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; diabetic complication; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; glycemic control; human; major clinical study; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; quality adjusted life year; sensitivity analysis; United Kingdom; agonists; body weight loss; chemically induced; complication; diabetic complication; drug effect; drug monitoring; drug resistance; economic model; economics; health care cost; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; quality of life; risk factor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046365711"

No approved chronic weight management medications have been prospectively investigated in individuals with overweight or obesity and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo on weight loss in this population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Satiety and Clinical AdipositydLiraglutide Evidence (SCALE) Insulin was a 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multicenter trial in individuals with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin and ≤2 oral antidiabetic drugs. RESULTS Individuals were randomized to liraglutide 3.0 mg (n = 198) or placebo (n = 198), combined with intensive behavioral therapy (IBT). At 56 weeks, mean weight change was ‒5.8% for liraglutide 3.0 mg versus ‒1.5% with placebo (estimated treatment difference ‒4.3% [95% CI ‒5.5; ‒3.2]; P < 0.0001). With liraglutide 3.0 mg, 51.8% of individuals achieved ≥5% weight loss versus 24.0% with placebo (odds ratio 3.41 [95% CI 2.19; 5.31]; P < 0.0001). Liraglutide 3.0 mg was associated with significantly greater reductions in mean HbA1c and mean daytime glucose values and less need for insulin versus placebo, despite a treat-to-glycemic-target protocol. More hypoglycemic events were observed with placebo than liraglutide 3.0 mg. No new safety or tolerability issues were observed. CONCLUSIONS In individuals with overweight or obesity and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, liraglutide 3.0 mg as an adjunct to IBT was superior to placebo regarding weight loss and improved glycemic control despite lower doses of basal insulin and without increases in hypoglycemic events. © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adiposity; Adult; Aged; Behavior Therapy; Blood Glucose; Combined Modality Therapy; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Insulin; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; antidiabetic agent; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; placebo; glycosylated hemoglobin; insulin; liraglutide; abdominal discomfort; adult; Article; behavior therapy; body mass; body weight loss; constipation; controlled study; diarrhea; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; female; glucose blood level; headache; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; aged; blood; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; complication; metabolism; multimodality cancer therapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physiology; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083914024"

Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711. Findings: Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was −2·3% for the placebo group versus −6·0% (0·05 mg), −8·6% (0·1 mg), −11·6% (0·2 mg), −11·2% (0·3 mg), and −13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p≤0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p≤0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (−13·8% to −11·2% vs −7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p<0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Interpretation: In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, improves glycaemic control and reduces bodyweight in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our aim was to assess the safety and efficacy of liraglutide 1·8 mg in patients with persistent or recurrent type 2 diabetes after metabolic surgery. Methods: In the GRAVITAS randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled adults who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or vertical sleeve gastrectomy and had persistent or recurrent type 2 diabetes with HbA1c levels higher than 48 mmol/mol (6·5%) at least 1 year after surgery from five hospitals in London, UK. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) via a computer-generated sequence to either subcutaneous liraglutide 1·8 mg once daily or placebo, both given together with a reduced-calorie diet, aiming for a 500 kcal per day deficit from baseline energy intake, and increased physical activity. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of the study period at 26 weeks, assessed in patients who completed the trial. Safety was assessed in the safety analysis population, consisting of all participants who received either liraglutide or placebo. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2014-003923-23, and the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN13643081. Findings: Between Jan 29, 2016, and May 2, 2018, we assigned 80 patients to receive either liraglutide (n=53) or placebo (n=27). 71 (89%) participants completed the study and were included in the principal complete-cases analysis. In a multivariable linear regression analysis, with baseline HbA1c levels and surgery type as covariates, liraglutide treatment was associated with a difference of −13·3 mmol/mol (−1·22%, 95% CI −19·7 to −7·0; p=0·0001) in HbA1c change from baseline to 26 weeks, compared with placebo. Type of surgery had no significant effect on the outcome. 24 (45%) of 53 patients assigned to liraglutide and 11 (41%) of 27 assigned to placebo reported adverse effects: these were mainly gastrointestinal and in line with previous experience with liraglutide. There was one death during the study in a patient assigned to the placebo group, which was considered unrelated to study treatment.

We hypothesized that the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, in combination with metformin, would reduce lipolysis. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 41 T2DM patients with coronary artery disease were randomized and treated with liraglutide-metformin vs placebo-metformin during 12- + 12-week periods with a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks before and between the intervention periods. NEFA kinetics were estimated using the Boston Minimal Model of NEFA metabolism, with plasma NEFA and glucose levels measured during a standard 180-minute frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Liraglutide-metformin reduced estimates of lipolysis. Furthermore, placebo-metformin increased estimates of lipid oxidation, while treatment with liraglutide eliminated this effect. We conclude that liraglutide exerts a clinically relevant reduction in estimates of lipolysis and lipid oxidation which is explained, in part, by improved insulin secretion, as revealed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","clinical trial; GLP-1 analogue; liraglutide; metformin; randomised trial; type 2 diabetes","Aged; Blood Glucose; Coronary Artery Disease; Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Lipid Metabolism; Lipolysis; Liraglutide; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Obesity; Oxidation-Reduction; Treatment Outcome; fatty acid derivative; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; antidiabetic agent; fatty acid; liraglutide; metformin; adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery disease; crossover procedure; diabetic patient; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug effect; fatty acid blood level; fatty acid metabolism; female; glucose blood level; human; insulin release; intravenous glucose tolerance test; lipid oxidation; lipolysis; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; randomized controlled trial; aged; blood; combination drug therapy; complication; coronary artery disease; drug effect; lipid metabolism; lipolysis; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oxidation reduction reaction; pathophysiology; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066603420"

We report the study design and patient baseline characteristics. Materials and methods: This 104-week, two-arm, open-label, active-controlled trial is active in 219 primary care practices across nine countries. At screening, eligible patients with T2D were at least 18 years of age, had been using a stable daily dose of metformin ≥1500 mg or the maximum tolerated dose for ≥60 days, and had a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.5% to 9.0%, measured ≤90 days before screening. Patients were randomized (1:1) to liraglutide or OAD, both in addition to pre-trial metformin. Individual OADs were chosen by the treating physician based on local guidelines. The primary endpoint is time to inadequate glycaemic control, defined as HbA1c above 7.0% at two scheduled consecutive visits after the first 26 weeks of treatment. Results: The trial randomized 1997 patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 56.9 (10.8) years, T2D duration of 7.2 (5.9) years (range, <1-47 years), and HbA1c of 8.2%. One-fifth of patients had a history of diabetes complications, and most were overweight (24.8%) or had obesity (65.3%). Conclusions: This pragmatically designed, large-scale, multinational, randomized clinical trial will help guide treatment decisions for patients with T2D who are inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy and treated in primary care. © 2019 The Authors.

Currently there are five prescription-only medications on the US market for the long-term management of obesity. However, these medications are underutilized by obese or overweight individuals seeking medical assistance for weight management. Areas covered: This special report provides an overview of the emerging obesity pharmacotherapies based on the data available from recruiting and active phase II/III trials from a registry of clinical trials. The authors also give their expert opinion and provide their future perspectives on the treatment of obesity based on what is known. Expert opinion: Despite obesity being a chronic condition affecting 40% of the US population, there is a low demand for obesity medications in the US market. Although the potential obesity medications that are currently being investigated in phase II/III clinical trials are promising, it is unclear whether the future pharmacotherapies will be enough to meet the health care need. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dapagliflozin; liraglutide; lorcaserin; MEDI0382; naltrexone/bupropion; Orlistat; phentermine/topiramate; semaglutide; setmelanotide; tesofensine","Anti-Obesity Agents; Appetite Depressants; Humans; Obesity; United States; Weight Loss; antiobesity agent; anorexigenic agent; antiobesity agent; anorexia; Article; forecasting; human; obesity; United States; body weight loss; drug effect; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075472689"

However, no studies have evaluated their long-term appetitive effects. Subjects/methods: This study examined changes in appetite in a subsample of 113 adults with obesity (76.1% female, 55.8% white, BMI = 38.8 ± 4.8 kg/m2) who participated in a 52-week trial. Participants were randomized to intensive behavioral therapy alone (IBT-alone), IBT with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day (IBT-liraglutide), or IBT-liraglutide combined with a 12-week meal replacement diet (Multi-component). Participants rated their hunger, fullness after meals, liking of meals, and food preoccupation (all as experienced over the past week) using visual analogue scales (0–100 mm). Ratings were completed at baseline and eight subsequent visits over the year. Results: At week 52, participants treated by IBT-alone lost 6.2 ± 1.6% of baseline weight, compared with 11.8 ± 1.6% and 12.1 ± 1.5% in the IBT-liraglutide and Multi-component groups, respectively. Compared to IBT-alone, IBT-liraglutide participants reported larger reductions at week 6 in hunger (−0.3 ± 4.2 vs −16.8 ± 4.0 mm, p =.005) and food preoccupation (+0.2 ± 3.7 vs −16.3 ± 3.6 mm, p =.002) and larger increases in fullness (−5.1 ± 3.2 vs +9.8 ± 3.0 mm, p =.001). These significant differences persisted at all assessments through week 24. There were no differences between IBT-alone and IBT-liraglutide in meal liking. IBT-alone and Multi-component participants differed in hunger at week 6, and in food preoccupation at all assessments through week 24. Multi-component participants reported reduced liking of meals relative to the IBT-alone and IBT-liraglutide groups through weeks 40 and 52, respectively. There were no other differences among any groups at week 52. Conclusions: Consistent with short-term studies, IBT-liraglutide participants reported greater improvements in hunger, fullness, and food preoccupation than those assigned to IBT-alone. Differences in appetite persisted for 24 weeks but were not maintained at week 52, despite the relatively greater weight losses in the liraglutide-treated participants at the trial’s end. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","","Adult; Aged; Appetite; Behavior Therapy; Craving; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Hunger; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Young Adult; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; adult; appetite; Article; behavior therapy; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug dose increase; feeding behavior; female; food craving; food preference; food preoccupation; human; hunger; major clinical study; male; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; aged; appetite; behavior therapy; craving; drug effect; feeding behavior; middle aged; obesity; psychology; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063801222"

When LSMs fail, the role of testosterone replacement treatment (TRT) is unclear. GLP1 receptor agonist liraglutide is linked to progressive and sustained weight loss. A potential direct impact of GLP1 on hypothalamus-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis was reported in animal models. We aimed to compare the effects of liraglutide and TRT on FH in obese men that had been poor responders to LSM, by means of reversal of FH and weight reduction. We designed a 16-week prospective randomized open-label study with 30 men (aged 46.5±10.9 years, BMI 41.2±8.4kg/m2, mean±s.d.) that were randomized to liraglutide 3.0mg QD (LIRA) or 50mg of 1% transdermal gel QD (TRT). Sexual function and anthropometric measures were assessed. Fasting blood was drawn for determination of endocrine and metabolic parameters followed by OGTT. Model-derived parameters including HOMAIR and calculated free testosterone (cFT) were calculated. Total testosterone significantly increased in both arms (+5.9±7.2 in TRT vs +2.6±3.5nmol/L in LIRA) and led to improved sexual function. LIRA resulted in a significant increase of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (P<0.001 for between-treatment effect). Subjects treated with LIRA lost on average 7.9±3.8 kg compared with a 0.9±4.5 kg loss in TRT (P<0.001). Metabolic syndrome was resolved in two patients in LIRA and in no subjects in TRT. Liraglutide was superior to TRT in improving an overall health benefit in men with obesity-associated FH after LSM failed. © 2019 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.","Functional hypogonadism; GLP1 receptor agonist; Liraglutide; Obesity","cholesterol; electrolyte; follitropin; glucose; glucose oxidase; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; lipid; liraglutide; luteinizing hormone; prostate specific antigen; testosterone; triacylglycerol; adult; aging male syndrome; androgen therapy; anthropometric parameters; antiobesity activity; Article; blood cell count; body weight loss; chemiluminescence immunoassay; clinical article; controlled study; drug dose titration; drug effect; ejaculation; high performance liquid chromatography; homeostasis model assessment; human; hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; immunoradiometric assay; insulin resistance; kidney function; libido; liver function; male; male genital system disease; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; patient-reported outcome; penis erection; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; sexual function","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064169711"

ApolipoproteinJ (ApoJ) has been implicated in altered pathophysiologic states including cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease. However, the function of ApoJ in regulation of glucose homeostasis remains unclear. This study sought to determine whether serum ApoJ levels are associated with insulin resistance in human subjects and if they change after interventions that improve insulin sensitivity. Methods Serum ApoJ levels and insulin resistance status were assessed in nondiabetic (ND) and type 2 diabetic (T2D) subjects. The impacts of rosiglitazone or metformin therapy on serum ApoJ levels and glucose disposal rate (GDR) during a hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp were evaluated in a separate cohort of T2D subjects. Total ApoJ protein or that associated with the HDL and LDL fractions was measured by immunoblotting or ELISA. Results Fasting serum ApoJ levels were greatly elevated in T2D subjects (ND vs T2D; 100 ± 8.3 vs. 150.6 ± 8.5 AU, P < 0.0001). Circulating ApoJ levels strongly correlated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and BMI. ApoJ levels were significantly and independently associated with HOMA-IR, even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI. Rosiglitazone treatment in T2D subjects resulted in a reduction in serum ApoJ levels (before vs. after treatment; 100 ± 13.9 vs. 77 ± 15.2 AU, P = 0.015), whereas metformin had no effect on ApoJ levels. The change in ApoJ levels during treatment was inversely associated with the change in GDR. Interestingly, ApoJ content in the LDL fraction was inversely associated with HOMA-IR. Conclusion Serum ApoJ levels are closely correlated with the magnitude of insulin resistance regardless of obesity, and decrease along with improvement of insulin resistance in response only to rosiglitazone in type 2 diabetes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Apolipoprotein J; Insulin resistance; Type 2 diabetes","Blood Glucose; Clusterin; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucose; Glucose Clamp Technique; Homeostasis; Humans; Hyperinsulinism; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Thiazolidinediones; canagliflozin; canagliflozin plus metformin; clusterin; glipizide; glipizide plus metformin; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; metformin plus pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; saxagliptin; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; antidiabetic agent; CLU protein, human; clusterin; glucose; insulin; metformin; rosiglitazone; adult; anthropometry; Article; body mass; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; diabetic patient; diet restriction; diet therapy; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug megadose; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; glucose blood level; homeostasis model assessment; human; hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique; immunoblotting; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lifestyle modification; lipoprotein blood level; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; risk reduction; serum; blood; drug effects; glucose clamp technique; homeostasis; hyperinsulinism; insulin resistance; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; risk factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033389924"

In patients undergoing bariatric surgery, it is critical to correctly classify diabetes subtype to prevent adverse perioperative outcomes including diabetic ketoacidosis. This study aimed to determine whether testing for C-peptide and islet cell antibodies during preoperative evaluation for bariatric surgery could improve the classification of type 1 versus type 2 diabetes compared to clinical assessment alone. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of the Improving Diabetes through Lifestyle and Surgery trial, which randomized patients with clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes and BMI 30–40 kg/m2 to medical weight loss or bariatric surgery; one participant was discovered to have type 1 diabetes after experiencing postoperative diabetic ketoacidosis. Using blood samples collected prior to study interventions, we measured islet cell antibodies and fasting/meal-stimulated C-peptide in all participants. Results: The participant with type 1 diabetes was similar to the 11 participants with type 2 diabetes in age at diagnosis, adiposity, and glycemic control but had the lowest C-peptide levels. Among insulin-treated participants, fasting and stimulated C-peptide correlated strongly with the C-peptide area-under-the-curve on mixed meal tolerance testing (R = 0.86 and 0.88, respectively). Three participants, including the one with type 1 diabetes, were islet cell antibody positive. Conclusions: Clinical characteristics did not correctly identify type 1 diabetes in this study. Preoperative C-peptide testing may improve diabetes classification in patients undergoing bariatric surgery; further research is needed to define the optimal C-peptide thresholds. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bariatric surgery; C-peptide, beta-cell; Perioperative care; Type 1 diabetes mellitus; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Adult; Autoantibodies; Bariatric Surgery; Blood Glucose; C-Peptide; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diagnosis, Differential; Fasting; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Postoperative Period; Retrospective Studies; Weight Loss; C peptide; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; pancreas islet cell antibody; autoantibody; C peptide; pancreas islet cell antibody; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; blood sampling; clinical article; clinical assessment; diabetic ketoacidosis; diabetic patient; differential diagnosis; disease classification; female; gastric banding; glucose homeostasis; glycemic control; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin treatment; laboratory test; male; meal; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; weight reduction; blood; body weight loss; complication; controlled study; diet restriction; differential diagnosis; glucose blood level; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; laboratory technique; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022228129"

The primary endpoint was the change in intrahepatic lipid (IHL) from baseline to week 26 as quantified by magnetic resonance imaging–estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Secondary endpoints included changes in abdominal adiposity (subcutaneous adipose tissue [SAT] and visceral adipose tissue [VAT]), glycated hemoglobin, and body weight from baseline to week 26. We analysed data from intent-to-treat population. MRI-PDFF, VAT, and weight decreased significantly with liraglutide (15.4% ± 5.6% to 12.5% ± 6.4%, P < 0.001; 171.4 ± 27.8 to 150.5 ± 30.8, P = 0.003; 86.6 ± 12.9 kg to 82.9 ± 11.1 kg, P = 0.005, respectively) and sitagliptin (15.5% ± 5.6% to 11.7% ± 5.0%, P = 0.001; 153.4 ± 31.5 to 139.8 ± 27.3, P = 0.027; 88.2 ± 13.6 kg to 86.5 ± 13.2 kg, P = 0.005, respectively). No significant change in MRI-PDFF, VAT, or body weight was observed with insulin glargine. SAT decreased significantly in the liraglutide group (239.9 ± 69.0 to 211.3 ± 76.1; P = 0.020) but not in the sitagliptin and insulin glargine groups. Changes from baseline in MRI-PDFF, VAT, and body weight were significantly greater with liraglutide than insulin glargine but did not differ significantly between liraglutide and sitagliptin. Conclusion: Combined with metformin, both liraglutide and sitagliptin, but not insulin glargine, reduced body weight, IHL, and VAT in addition to improving glycemic control in patients with T2DM and NAFLD. © 2018 The Authors.

We investigated the changes in arterial stiffness and left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation after 6-month treatment with the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide in subjects with newly diagnosed T2DM. Methods: We randomized 60 patients with newly diagnosed and treatment-naive T2DM to receive either liraglutide (n = 30) or metformin (n = 30) for 6 months. We measured at baseline and after 6-month treatment: (a) carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) (b) LV longitudinal strain (GLS), and strain rate (GLSR), peak twisting (pTw), peak twisting velocity (pTwVel) and peak untwisting velocity (pUtwVel) using speckle tracking echocardiography. LV untwisting was calculated as the percentage difference between peak twisting and untwisting at MVO (%dpTw-UtwMVO), at peak (%dpTw-UtwPEF) and end of early LV diastolic filling (%dpTw-UtwEDF) (c) Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and percentage difference of FMD (FMD%) (d) malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs) and NT-proBNP. Results: After 6-months treatment, subjects that received liraglutide presented with a reduced PWV (11.8 ± 2.5 vs. 10.3 ± 3.3 m/s), MDA (0.92 [0.45-2.45] vs. 0.68 [0.43-2.08] nM/L) and NT-proBNP (p < 0.05) in parallel with an increase in GLS (- 15.4 ± 3 vs. - 16.6 ± 2.7), GLSR (0.77 ± 0.2 vs. 0.89 ± 0.2), pUtwVel (- 97 ± 49 vs. - 112 ± 52°, p < 0.05), %dpTw-UtwMVO (31 ± 10 vs. 40 ± 14), %dpTw-UtwPEF (43 ± 19 vs. 53 ± 22) and FMD% (8.9 ± 3 vs. 13.2 ± 6, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences of the measured markers in subjects that received metformin except for an improvement in FMD. In all subjects, PCs levels at baseline were negatively related to the difference of GLS (r = - 0.53) post-treatment and the difference of MDA was associated with the difference of PWV (r = 0.52) (p < 0.05 for all associations) after 6-month treatment. Conclusions: Six-month treatment with liraglutide improves arterial stiffness, LV myocardial strain, LV twisting and untwisting and NT-proBNP by reducing oxidative stress in subjects with newly diagnosed T2DM.

The potential impact of short-term preconception intervention with liraglutide on fertility potential in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not been evaluated yet. Design: A prospective randomized open-label study was conducted in 28 infertile obese PCOS patients (age: 31.07±4.75, BMI: 36.7±3.5kg/m2, mean±s.d.). They were assigned to metformin (MET) 1000mg BID or to MET 1000mg BID combined with low-dose liraglutide 1.2mg QD s.c. (COMBI) for 12 weeks. Ovarian stimulation protocol was started after a 4-week medication-free period. Methods: The in vitro fertilization pregnancy rate (PR) was defined as the number of clinical pregnancies confirmed by ultrasound visualization of the fetal cardiac activity, divided by the total number of cycles performed or embryo transfers (ET). The spontaneous PR was followed for 12 months. Results: Patients in the MET group on average lost 7.0±6.0kg (P=0.001) compared with 7.5±3.9kg in the COMBI group (P<0.001) with no significant between-treatment difference (P=0.246). The PR per ET was significantly higher in the COMBI (85.7%) compared with the MET (28.6%) group (P=0.03). The cumulative PR in the time frame of 12 months was 69.2% in the COMBI group compared to 35.7% in the MET group. Conclusions: Preconception intervention with low-dose liraglutide added to metformin is superior to metformin alone in increasing PRs per ET and cumulative PRs in infertile obese women with PCOS, despite comparable weight reduction in both groups. A potential impact of liraglutide on the reproductive system needs further exploration, in particular the GLP-1 impact on endometrial quality and receptivity. © 2018 European Society of Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.","","Adult; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Infertility, Female; Liraglutide; Metformin; Obesity; Ovulation Induction; Pilot Projects; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Rate; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Treatment Outcome; androstenedione; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; metformin; adult; androstenedione blood level; Article; body mass; body weight loss; clinical article; controlled study; diarrhea; drug dose increase; embryo transfer; fat pad; female; female infertility; fetal cardiac activity; fetus heart; gastrointestinal symptom; glucose blood level; headache; heart function; homeostasis model assessment; human; in vitro fertilization; insulin blood level; intra-abdominal fat; lifestyle modification; low drug dose; nausea; obesity; oocyte retrieval; open study; oral glucose tolerance test; ovary polycystic disease; parthenogenesis; pilot study; pregnancy rate; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; testosterone blood level; transvaginal echography; treatment response; waist circumference; combination drug therapy; complication; female infertility; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; ovary polycystic disease; ovulation induction; pregnancy; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049097502"

Methods: In a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study, 32 participants with normal or mildly impaired glucose tolerance received liraglutide and placebo for 3 weeks each. Insulin suppression tests (IST) were conducted at baseline and after a 24-hour SFA-enriched diet after each treatment. Plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured over the initial 8 hours (breakfast and lunch) on the SFA diet. A subset of participants underwent ex vivo measurements of insulin-mediated vasodilation of adipose tissue arterioles and glucose metabolism regulatory proteins in skeletal muscle. Results: Liraglutide reduced plasma glucose, triglycerides and NEFA concentrations during the SFA diet (by 50%, 25% and 9%, respectively), and the SFA diet increased plasma glucose during the IST (by 36%; all P <.01 vs placebo). The SFA diet-induced impairment of vasodilation on placebo (−9.4% vs baseline; P <.01) was ameliorated by liraglutide (−4.8%; P =.1 vs baseline). In skeletal muscle, liraglutide abolished the SFA-induced increase in thioredoxin-interacting protein (TxNIP) expression (75% decrease; P <.01 vs placebo) and increased 5′AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation (50% vs −3%; P =.04 vs placebo).

Liraglutide improves cardiovascular prognosis through partly unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that treatment with liraglutide improves CMD and symptoms through weight loss, in non-diabetic overweight patients with angina and no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: We included 33 non-diabetic overweight women (BMI > 25) with CMD (Coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) ≤2.5), angina symptoms and no obstructive CAD, in an open-label proof-of-concept study. The protocol included a control period of 5 weeks followed by an intervention period with liraglutide aiming at 3 mg daily for 12 weeks. Participants were investigated before and after the control period and again 1–2 weeks after last liraglutide dose. Primary outcomes were change in CFVR and change in angina symptoms measured by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) in the intervention period compared with the control period. (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02602600, and ethically approved). Results: Twenty-nine participants completed the study. Liraglutide treatment led to a significant weight loss (mean 6.03 kg (95%CI: 5.22;6.84)) and decrease in systolic blood pressure (mean 10.95 mm Hg (95%CI: 4.60;17.30)). Baseline median CFVR was 2.30 (IQR 1.91;2.51) and remained unchanged after liraglutide treatment (mean change 0.07 (95%CI: −0.07;0.21)). There were no effects on symptoms measured by SAQ or parameters of left ventricular systolic as well as diastolic function. Conclusions: Treatment with liraglutide led to significant weight loss and lowering of blood pressure with no concomitant symptoms alleviation during treatment and no improvement in coronary microvascular function. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Angina; Coronary flow velocity reserve; Coronary microvascular dysfunction; Liraglutide; Microvascular angina","Aged; Angina Pectoris; Body Weight; Coronary Circulation; Coronary Vessels; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Echocardiography; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Microcirculation; Middle Aged; Overweight; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Function, Left; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; adult; aged; angina pectoris; Article; body weight loss; cardiovascular disease assessment; clinical article; clinical trial; coronary flow reserve; coronary microvascular dysfunction; drug dose increase; drug dose titration; female; heart left ventricle function; human; left ventricular diastolic function; left ventricular systolic function; microangiopathy; obesity; open study; patient compliance; priority journal; proof of concept; Seattle Angina Questionnaire; systolic blood pressure; unspecified side effect; angina pectoris; body weight; complication; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; coronary blood vessel; diagnostic imaging; dose response; drug effect; echocardiography; heart ventricle; microcirculation; middle aged; obesity; pathophysiology; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061442371"

Materials and methods: This study analyzed a representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries from the combined 2008–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Population characteristics, cost and effectiveness of anti-obesity interventions, and the sustainability of weight loss in real-life were modeled to project the budgetary impact on gross Medicare outlay over 10 years. Hypothetical scenarios of 50% and 67% increases in intervention participation above base case were used to model moderate and extensive Medicare coverage expansion of intensive behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy. Results: For each Medicare beneficiary receiving anti-obesity treatment, we estimate Medicare savings of $6,842 and $7,155 over 10 years under moderate and extensive coverage utilization assumptions, respectively. The average cost of intervention is $1,798 and $1,886 per treated participant. Taking the entire Medicare population (treated and untreated) into consideration, the estimated 10-year budget savings per beneficiary are $308 and $339 under moderate and extensive assumptions, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of drug adherence rate and weight-loss efficacy indicated a potential variation of budget savings within 7% and 22% of the base case, respectively. Most of the projected cost savings come from lower utilization of ambulatory services and prescription drugs. Limitations: Due to the scarcity of studies on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy among older adults with obesity, the simulated weight loss and long-term maintenance effects were derived from clinical trial outcomes, in which older adults were mostly excluded from participation. The model did not include potential side-effects from anti-obesity medications and associated costs. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that expanding coverage of anti-obesity interventions to eligible individuals could generate $20–$23 billion budgetary savings to Medicare over 10 years. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","budget impact; coverage; Medicare; Obesity; pharmacotherapy; policy; prevention; weight loss","Aged; Budgets; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Health Care Costs; Health Surveys; Humans; Insurance Coverage; Male; Medicare; Obesity; United States; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; liraglutide; lorcaserin; phentermine plus topiramate; aged; ambulatory care; Article; behavior therapy; body weight loss; budget; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; female; health care cost; health care utilization; human; major clinical study; male; medicare; medication compliance; obesity; patient compliance; pharmaceutical care; budget; cost benefit analysis; economics; health care cost; health survey; insurance; medicare; obesity; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070943725"

Liraglutide 3 mg (LIRA 3 mg) is an effective weight-loss medication, but weight loss in individual patients is variable, and its efficacy has not been assessed in SWMS. This study aims to investigate whether a targeted prescribing pathway for LIRA 3 mg with multiple prespecified stopping rules could help people with severe obesity and established complications achieve ≥15% weight loss in order to determine whether this could be considered a clinically effective and cost-effective strategy for managing severe and complex obesity in SWMS. Methods and analysis In this 2-year, multicentre, open-label, real-world randomised controlled trial, 384 adults with severe and complex obesity (defined as body mass index ≥35 kg/m 2 plus either prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnoea) will be randomised via a 2:1 ratio to receive either standard SWMS care (n=128) or standard SWMS care plus a targeted prescribing pathway for LIRA 3 mg with prespecified stopping rules at 16, 32 and 52 weeks (n=256). The primary outcome is to compare the proportion of participants achieving a weight loss of ≥15% at 52 weeks with a targeted prescribing pathway versus standard care. Secondary outcomes include a comparison of (1) the weight loss maintenance at 104 weeks and (2) the budget impact and cost effectiveness between the two groups in a real-world setting.

Since glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues can reduce ectopic fat accumulation, the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of treatment with liraglutide for 26 weeks on ectopic fat deposition and HbA1c in South Asian patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: In a placebo-controlled trial, 47 South Asian patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to treatment with liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) or placebo added to standard care. At baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment we assessed abdominal subcutaneous, visceral, epicardial and paracardial adipose tissue volume using MRI. Furthermore, myocardial and hepatic triglyceride content were examined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: In the intention-to-treat analysis, liraglutide decreased body weight compared to placebo (- 3.9 ± 3.6 kg vs - 0.6 ± 2.2 kg; mean change from baseline (liraglutide vs placebo): - 3.5 kg; 95% CI [- 5.3, - 1.8]) without significant effects on the different adipose tissue compartments. HbA1c was decreased in both groups without between group differences. In the per-protocol analysis, liraglutide did decrease visceral adipose tissue volume compared to placebo (- 23 ± 27 cm2 vs - 2 ± 17 cm2; mean change from baseline (liraglutide vs placebo): - 17 cm2; 95% CI [- 32, - 3]). Furthermore, HbA1c was decreased by liraglutide compared to placebo (- 1.0 ± 0.8% (- 10.5 ± 9.1 mmol/mol)) vs (- 0.6 ± 0.8% (- 6.1 ± 8.8 mmol/mol)), with a between group difference (mean change from baseline (liraglutide vs placebo): - 0.6% (- 6.5 mmol/mol); 95% CI [- 1.1, - 0.1 (- 11.5, - 1.5)]). Interestingly, the decrease of visceral adipose tissue volume was associated with the reduction of HbA1c (β: 0.165 mmol/mol (0.015%) per 1 cm2 decrease of visceral adipose tissue volume; 95% CI [0.062, 0.267 (0.006, 0.024%)]). Conclusions: While the intention-to-treat analysis did not show effects of liraglutide on ectopic fat and HbA1c, per-protocol analysis showed that liraglutide decreases visceral adipose tissue volume, which was associated with improved glycaemic control in South Asians.

Materials and methods: In a randomized crossover study, 11 women who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and had documented hypoglycaemia were each evaluated during a baseline period without treatment and during five treatment periods with the following interventions: acarbose 50 mg for 1 week, sitagliptin 100 mg for 1 week, verapamil 120 mg for 1 week, liraglutide 1.2 mg for 3 weeks and pasireotide 300 μg as a single dose. Treatment effects were evaluated by a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) and, for all treatment periods except pasireotide, by 6 days of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Results: Treatment with acarbose and treatment with pasireotide both significantly lifted nadir glucose levels (mean ± SEM 3.9 ± 0.2 and 7.9 ± 0.4 vs 3.4 ± 0.2; P <.03) and reduced time in hypoglycaemia during the MMTTs. Acarbose reduced peak glucose levels and time in hyperglycaemia, whereas pasireotide greatly increased both variables. Acarbose and pasireotide reduced insulin and C-peptide levels, and pasireotide also diminished glucagon-like peptide-1 levels. Sitagliptin lowered nadir glucose values, while verapamil and liraglutide had no effect on hypoglycaemia. During the CGM periods, the treatments had no impact on hypoglycaemia, whereas acarbose and liraglutide reduced hyperglycaemia and glycaemic variability. Conclusions: In an experimental setting, treatment with acarbose and pasireotide reduced PBH. Acarbose appears to have an overall glucose-stabilizing effect, whereas pasireotide leads to increased and sustained hyperglycaemia. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bariatric surgery; clinical trial; continuous glucose monitoring; GLP-1; hypoglycaemia","Acarbose; Adult; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Gastric Bypass; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid; Postoperative Complications; Postprandial Period; Sitagliptin Phosphate; Somatostatin; Treatment Outcome; Verapamil; acarbose; C peptide; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; pasireotide; sitagliptin; verapamil; acarbose; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; pasireotide; sitagliptin; somatostatin; verapamil; abdominal pain; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; bloating; blood glucose monitoring; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; daily life activity; diarrhea; drug dose titration; drug effect; drug efficacy; fatigue; female; flatulence; glucose blood level; hormone response; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; loss of appetite; male; nausea; nutritional tolerance; postprandial state; randomized controlled trial; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; single drug dose; treatment response; adverse event; blood; gastric bypass surgery; hypoglycemia; middle aged; morbid obesity; postoperative complication; postprandial state; procedures; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068036937"

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) cause weight loss by reducing appetite. We assessed the effect of the GLP-1 RA liraglutide 3.0 mg for 16 weeks in 14 obese individuals with pathogenic MC4R mutations (BMI 37.5 ± 6.8) and 28 matched control participants without MC4R mutation (BMI 36.8 ± 4.8). Liraglutide decreased body weight by 6.8 kg ± 1.8 kg in individuals with pathogenic MC4R mutations and by 6.1 kg ± 1.2 kg in control participants. Total body fat, waist circumference, and fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations similarly decreased in both groups. Thus, liraglutide induced an equal, clinically significant weight loss of 6% in both groups, indicating that the appetite-reducing effect of liraglutide is preserved in MC4R causal obesity and that liraglutide acts independently of the MC4R pathway. Thus, liraglutide could be an effective treatment of the most common form of monogenic obesity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.; Iepsen et al. show that the diabetes and obesity drug liraglutide, which has appetite-suppressing effects, caused weight loss in obese patients with mutations in the appetite-regulating melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). These results show that the appetite effects of liraglutide are independent of the MC4R pathway and offer therapeutic opportunities for patients with MC4R causal obesity.","appetite regulation; GLP-1 RAs; GLP-1 receptor agonists; hypothalamus; liraglutide; MC4R mutations; monogenic obesity; obesity; treatment; weight loss","Adult; Appetite; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Obesity; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4; Weight Loss; glucose; liraglutide; melanocortin 4 receptor; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; MC4R protein, human; melanocortin 4 receptor; adult; Article; body fat; body weight loss; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug dose increase; drug efficacy; fat mass; female; gene mutation; glucose blood level; hip circumference; human; lipid metabolism; male; nausea; obesity; pathogenesis; priority journal; treatment duration; waist circumference; appetite; drug effect; genetics; middle aged; mutation; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047381155"

Methods: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane database and clinicaltrials.gov was performed to identify controlled trials (up to 15 June 2019) of GLP-1RAs with a cardiovascular endpoint. The principal endpoint of the present meta-analysis was MACE; secondary endpoints included myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure. Mantel–Haenszel odds ratios (MH-ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all outcomes. Results: In the seven trials included, all placebo-controlled, GLP-1RA treatment was associated with a reduction in MACE (MH-OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.81, 0.93]). Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke were also reduced (MH-OR 0.88 [95% CI 0.80, 0.96], MH-OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.82, 0.98], MH-OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.84, 0.98] and MH-OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.77, 0.97], respectively). Results for hospitalization for heart failure were not statistically significant (MH-OR 0.93 [95% CI 0.83, 1.04]). The meta-analyses of patient subgroups showed a significant reduction in MACE with GLP-1RAs, irrespective of gender, advanced age and obesity. Conclusions: GLP-1RAs are associated with a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with diabetes. This effect does not appear to be moderated by gender or body mass index. The possibility of different effects of GLP-1RAs between patients in primary and secondary prevention merits further investigation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; major cardiovascular events; meta-analysis; mortality","Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular System; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; albiglutide; dulaglutide; exendin 4; liraglutide; lixisenatide; placebo; semaglutide; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; age distribution; all cause mortality; Article; body mass; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; comorbidity; diabetes mellitus; drug effect; heart failure; heart infarction; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; incidence; meta analysis; mortality rate; obesity; sex difference; systematic review; adverse drug reaction; aged; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular system; complication; diabetic angiopathy; female; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074578178"

Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues effectively treat obesity and type 2 diabetes and may offer potential for NAFLD treatment. Aim: To evaluate the effect of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, semaglutide, on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in subjects at risk of NAFLD. Methods: Data from a 104-week cardiovascular outcomes trial in type 2 diabetes (semaglutide 0.5 or 1.0 mg/week) and a 52-week weight management trial (semaglutide 0.05-0.4 mg/day) were analysed. Treatment ratios vs placebo were estimated for ALT (both trials) and hsCRP (weight management trial only) using a mixed model for repeated measurements, with or without adjustment for change in body weight. Results: Elevated baseline ALT (men >30 IU/L; women >19 IU/L) was present in 52% (499/957) of weight management trial subjects. In this group with elevated ALT, end-of-treatment ALT reductions were 6%-21% (P<0.05 for doses≥0.2 mg/day) and hsCRP reductions 25%-43% vs placebo (P < 0.05 for 0.2 and 0.4 mg/day). Normalisation of elevated baseline ALT occurred in 25%-46% of weight management trial subjects, vs 18% on placebo. Elevated baseline ALT was present in 41% (1325/3268) of cardiovascular outcomes trial subjects. In this group with elevated ALT, no significant ALT reduction was noted at end-of-treatment for 0.5 mg/week, while a 9% reduction vs placebo was seen for 1.0 mg/week (P = 0.0024). Treatment ratios for changes in ALT and hsCRP were not statistically significant after adjustment for weight change. Conclusions: Semaglutide significantly reduced ALT and hsCRP in clinical trials in subjects with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. © 2019 The Authors.

Hyperglycemia, the hallmark of diabetes, has long been considered the link between diabetes and CVD, and many trials focused on preventing CVD manifestations by means of tight glucose control. However, diabetes is a multifactorial disease in which, e. g., insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia contribute. Thus, treatment needs to be multifactorial and take cardiovascular aspects into account. Newer classes of drugs, originally launched for glucose lowering, among them dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists, have been studied in large cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOT). Several SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with a reduction of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke). Although the mechanisms behind the effects are not fully understood, an important reason for the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors seems be a reduction in heart failure, while GLP-1 receptor agonists may retard the development of the atherosclerotic vascular disease or may be effective by stabilizing plaques. The outcomes of these studies have been taken into account in recently issued guidelines and an important task for diabetologists, cardiologists, and general practitioners is to incorporate the findings of these trials into clinical practice. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cardiac diseases; Diabetes mellitus, adult-onset; Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors; Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists; Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors","Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; albiglutide; alogliptin; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; empagliflozin; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin degludec; insulin glargine; linagliptin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; pioglitazone; placebo; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; Article; blood glucose monitoring; cardiovascular disease; disease association; human; hypoglycemia; insulin resistance; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreatitis; population research; treatment outcome; urinary tract infection; cardiovascular disease; complication; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062155882"

Methods: We performed a systematic literature review through February 28, 2017 to identify randomized clinical trials of the effects of Food and Drug Administration−approved weight-loss medications (ie, orlistat, lorcaserin, naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, and liraglutide) administered to obese adults for 1 year or more, compared with placebo or another active agent. Outcomes of interest included changes in blood glucose (fasting blood glucose [FBG] and hemoglobin A1c), cholesterol profile (low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoproteins), blood pressure (BP; systolic/diastolic), and waist circumference (WC). We performed pair-wise and network meta-analyses with outcomes reported as weighted and standardized mean differences. Quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Results: In a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials (29,018 participants; median body mass index, 36.1 kg/m2), we associated weight-loss medications with a modest decrease in FBG (weighted mean difference, 4.0 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, –4.4 to –3.6 mg/dL) and WC (weighted mean difference, reduction of 3.3 cm; 95% confidence interval, –3.5 to –3.1 cm), without clinically meaningful changes in systolic/diastolic BP or cholesterol profile vs placebo (standardized mean difference <0.2); effects varied among drugs. Phentermine-topiramate use was associated with a substantial decrease in WC and a modest decrease in FBG, hemoglobin A1c, and BP, and had minimal effect on cholesterol. Liraglutide use was associated with a substantial decrease in FBG, hemoglobin A1c, and WC, and a minimal effect on BP and cholesterol. Naltrexone-bupropion use was associated with moderate increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but had a minimal effect on FBG and WC. Orlistat use was associated with a decrease in low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. No drug improved all cardiometabolic risk factors. Conclusions: In a systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found Food and Drug Administration−approved weight-loss medications to have only modest positive effects on cardiometabolic risk profile. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term cardiometabolic benefits of these medications.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), the visceral fat depot of the heart, is a modifiable cardio-metbolic risk factor and therapeutic target. Semaglutide and dulaglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, are indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GLP-1 receptor agonists have recently shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Epicardial adipose tissue expresses GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide is known to significantly decrease EAT thickness. However, the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists semaglutide and dulaglutide on EAT thickness are unknown. Materials and Methods. We performed a 12-week, controlled, parallel study in 80 subjects with T2DM and obesity. Patients received either semaglutide, up to 1 mg subcutaneous (sc) weekly, or dulaglutide, up to 1.5 mg sc weekly, as the standard of care in addition to their usual medication regimen. Twenty subjects with T2DM and obesity were started on metformin and a diet and served as the control group. Ultrasound-measured EAT thickness was measured at baseline and at the 12-week follow-up. Results. Epicardial adipose tissue thickness significantly decreased in both semaglutide and dulaglutide groups (P < 0.001) after 12 weeks, accounting for a 20% reduction. There was no EAT reduction in the metformin group. Body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c improved in all groups without reaching statistical significance. Epicardial adipose tissue thickness reduction was significantly greater (P < 0.01) with the higher doses of semaglutide (1 mg) and dulaglutide (1.5 mg), respectively. Conclusion. Weekly administration of either GLP-1 receptor agonists semaglutide or dulaglutide causes a rapid, substantial, and dose-dependent reduction in EAT thickness. © Endocrine Society 2020.

The present study is the first insight into the potential prevention of weight regain in obese subjects who have been withdrawn from liraglutide. We evaluated whether dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin in adjunct to metformin prevents body weight regain more effectively than metformin alone in obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) previously treated with liraglutide. Methods: A 12-week prospective randomized open-label study was conducted with 24 obese women with PCOS who had been pretreated with liraglutide 3.0 mg due to antiobesity management (aged 34.3 ± 6.8 years, body mass index [BMI] 36.3 ± 5.2 kg/m2, mean ± standard deviation). They were randomized to combined treatment (COMBO) with sitagliptin 100 mg per day (QD) and metformin (MET) 1000 mg twice daily (BID) (n = 12) or MET 1000 mg BID (n = 12). Lifestyle intervention was promoted in both groups. The primary outcome was change in anthropometric measures of obesity. Results: Women treated with MET regain 4.7 ± 2.7 kg (P = 0.002) compared with a 0.9 ± 2.5 kg in COMBO (P = 0.147). BMI increased for 1.7 ± 0.9 kg/m2 in MET (P = 0.002) compared with 0.3 ± 0.8 kg/m2 increase in COMBO (P = 0.136). MET group regain 4.5% ± 2.5% of body weight as opposed to 0.8% ± 2.6% in COMBO. The between-treatment differences were significant for weight change (P < 0.001), percentage of weight change (P < 0.001), and BMI change (P < 0.001). Greater ability to resist emotional eating was demonstrated in COMBO. Conclusion: Sitagliptin in adjunct to metformin prevented weight regain in obese women with PCOS previously treated with liraglutide. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","DPP-4 inhibitor; GLP-1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; PCOS; sitagliptin; weight maintenance","Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Middle Aged; Obesity; Pilot Projects; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Prospective Studies; Sitagliptin Phosphate; Weight Gain; liraglutide; metformin; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; liraglutide; sitagliptin; adult; anthropometry; Article; body mass; body weight; clinical article; female; human; metabolism parameters; obesity; open study; ovary polycystic disease; pilot study; priority journal; treatment duration; treatment outcome; waist circumference; weight gain; weight reduction; aged; body weight gain; complication; controlled study; drug effect; feeding behavior; middle aged; obesity; ovary polycystic disease; prospective study; randomized controlled trial","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037684687"

Experimental combination pharmacotherapies include combinations of pramlintide and phentermine as well as amylin and bupropion-naltrexone. Incretin and pancreatic hormones generally inhibit upper gastrointestinal motor functions, and combinations showing efficacy in obesity are coadministration of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) with glucagon, a unimolecular dual incretin of PEGylated GLP-1/GIP coagonist, the combination of GLP-1 and PYY3-36, and, in proof of concept studies, combined infusions of GLP-1, peptide YY, and oxyntomodulin. Among bariatric procedures, repeat intragastric balloon (IGB) treatments are more efficacious than IGB plus diet, and endoscopic intervention can enhance the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass when weight regain occurs. A first trial has provided promising results with combination of IGB plus the GLP-1 analog, liraglutide, compared to the balloon alone. Thus, combination therapies for the treatment of obesity hold promise for introduction into clinical practice. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.","GLP-1; glucagon; obesity; pharmacotherapies","Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Bariatric Surgery; Caloric Restriction; Combined Modality Therapy; Diet, Reducing; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Obesity; Treatment Outcome; Weight Gain; Weight Loss; antiobesity agent; animal; bariatric surgery; body weight gain; body weight loss; caloric restriction; disease model; drug effect; human; low calorie diet; multimodality cancer therapy; obesity; pathophysiology; procedures; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054418668"

Methods: In a double-blinded cross-over fashion, 15 participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive placebo (saline solution) or liraglutide for 24 weeks including a 1-month titration period from 0.6 to 1.2 to 1.8 mg, in addition to their insulin. The treatment was followed by a 1-month wash-out period. Participants were then assigned to the other treatment for another 24 weeks. Paired rank tests were used to compare the metabolic parameters. Results: There was no treatment effect on HbA1c nor on insulin dose. Heart rate was increased by about 8 beats per minute with liraglutide. There were significant reductions in metabolic measures: weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, body fatness, computed tomography scan abdominal and mid-thigh measurements, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (all P ≤.05). There was no increase in time spent in hypoglycaemia with liraglutide. Conclusions: The addition of liraglutide to basal/bolus insulin therapy for 24 weeks in overweight/obese individuals with type 1 diabetes improved the anthropometric and metabolic profiles without an increase in hypoglycaemia.

Thirty-five metformin-treated obese subjects with prediabetes or newly-diagnosed T2DM were randomized to the glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist (GLP-RA) liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) or lifestyle counseling until achieving a comparable weight loss (−7% of initial body weight), to assess whether changes in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue distribution (MRI), insulin sensitivity (Matsuda Index) and beta-cell performance (multiple sampling OGTT beta-index), with either intervention, might affect TX-dependent platelet activation, lipid peroxidation and inflammation. At baseline, Ln-8-iso-PGF2α (Beta = 0.31, p = 0.0088), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (Beta = 2.64, p = 0.0011) Ln-TNF-α (Beta = 0.58, p = 0.0075) and SAT (Beta = 0.14, p = 0.044) were significant independent predictors of 11-dehydro-TXB2. After achievement of the weight loss target, a comparable reduction in U-11-dehydro-TXB2 (between-group p = 0.679) and 8-iso-PGF-2α (p = 0.985) was observed in both arms in parallel with a comparable improvement in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, SAT, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In obese patients with initial impairment of glucose metabolism, the extent of platelet activation is related to systemic inflammation, isoprostane formation and degree of glycemic control and abdominal SAT. Successful weight loss, achieved with either lifestyle changes or an incretin-based therapy, is associated with a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and platelet activation. © 2018 by the authors.

Materials and methods: A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 44 overweight or obese adults with type 1 diabetes randomized 1:1 to liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily (QD) or placebo added to CSII treatment. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints included change in insulin dose, CSII settings, glycaemic variability, body weight and patient-reported outcome measures. Finally, adverse effects including hypoglycaemic events were registered. Results: HbA1c was reduced by 5 mmol/mol (0.5%) from a baseline of 66 mmol/mol (8.2%) in patients treated with liraglutide compared with a non-significant change of +2.3 mmol/mol (0.2%) from a baseline of 66 mmol/mol (8.1%) in patients treated with placebo (between-group difference 7 mmol/mol [0.7%], P < 0.001). Liraglutide reduced total insulin dose by 8 units/day or 16% of total insulin dose (P = 0.008). Mean body weight was reduced by 6.3 kg (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Concomitantly, time spent in glycaemic target range 4–10 mmol/L (71–180 mg/dL) increased while the risk of hypoglycaemia did not differ between groups at the end of treatment. Conclusion: Liraglutide treatment reduced HbA1c, total daily insulin dose and body weight without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia in CSII-treated patients with type 1 diabetes and insufficient glycaemic control. Liraglutide may be considered a potential add-on therapy to insulin in this subgroup of patients. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","Adult; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Liraglutide; Overweight; Treatment Outcome; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; placebo; antidiabetic agent; glycosylated hemoglobin; liraglutide; adult; allergic reaction; angina pectoris; arthritis; Article; body mass; body weight loss; clinical article; constipation; continuous infusion; controlled study; decreased appetite; diarrhea; dizziness; double blind procedure; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; dyspepsia; fatigue; female; gastrointestinal symptom; glycemic control; headache; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; nausea; obesity; pneumonia; randomized controlled trial; stomach pain; vomiting; body weight; combination drug therapy; complication; hyperglycemia; obesity; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076762593"

This study aimed to assess the effects of intensive lifestyle modification (ILM) with or without 3-mg liraglutide daily vs. sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on BMI after 1 year. Subjects/methods: In this study performed at an Italian university hospital, non-diabetic patients eligible for bariatric surgery were recruited from a weight-loss clinic and had the option to choose from three possible weight-loss programmes up to an allocation of 25 subjects in each arm matched by BMI and age. ILM consisted in 813 kcal of a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) for 1 month, followed by a diet of 12 kcal/kg body weight of high protein and high fat for 11 months plus 30 min of brisk walking daily and at least 3 h of aerobic exercise weekly. SG patients followed a VLCD for 1 month and a free diet thereafter. Patients were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Results: A total of 75 patients were enrolled; retention was 100% in the SG and 85% in the two medical arms. SG reduced BMI by 32% (P < 0.001 vs. medical arm), while ILM + liraglutide and ILM led to BMI reductions of 24% and 14%, respectively (P < 0.001). More women allocated themselves to the ILM + liraglutide group. Weight loss was 43 kg with SG, 26 kg with ILM + liraglutide and 15 kg with ILM alone. Lean body mass reductions were −11.6 kg with SG, −6.3 kg with ILM and −8.3 kg with ILM + liraglutide. Prevalence of prediabetes was significantly lower with ILM + liraglutide, and insulin resistance was reduced by about 70% by both ILM + liraglutide and SG vs. 39% by ILM alone. Cardiometabolic risk factors were greatly reduced in all three groups. Discussion: At least in the short-term, liraglutide 3.0 mg once daily associated with drastic calorie-intake restriction and intensive physical activity promoted a 24% weight loss, which was almost two times greater than ILM alone and only about 25% less than with SG, while preserving lean body mass. Although this study was non-randomised, it was designed to explore the efficacy of medical treatments for obesity in everyday clinical practice. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Bariatric surgery; Body composition; Lifestyle modifications; Liraglutide; Obesity; Very low-calorie diet","Adult; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Gastrectomy; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Life Style; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid; Pilot Projects; Treatment Outcome; liraglutide; protein concentrate plus carbohydrates plus lipids plus minerals plus vitamins; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; adult; aerobic exercise; age; aged; Article; bariatric surgery; body mass; body weight loss; cereal; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug dose increase; drug dose titration; female; follow up; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; intensive lifestyle modification; intermethod comparison; lean body weight; lifestyle modification; lipid diet; low calory diet; major clinical study; male; pilot study; prevalence; protein diet; side effect; sleeve gastrectomy; university hospital; walking; comparative study; diet therapy; gastrectomy; lifestyle; middle aged; morbid obesity; multimodality cancer therapy; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041575467"

Little is known about their effects on food hedonic sensations and taste perception in poor controlled patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Materials and methods: Eighteen T2D patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and poor controlled glycemia were studied before and after 3 months of treatment with Liraglutide. Detection thresholds for salty, sweet and bitter tastes, optimal preferences, olfactory liking, wanting and recalled liking for several food items were assessed. Subjects also answered questionnaires to measure their attitudes to food. Results: T2D patients had a significant decrease in bodyweight and HbA1c after treatment with Liraglutide. Liraglutide improved gustative detection threshold of sweet flavors, and decreased wanting for sweet foods and recalled liking for fatty foods. It also led to a decrease in feelings of hunger. Conclusions: Liraglutide increases sensitivity to sweet tastes and decreases pleasure responses for fatty foods in poor controlled T2D patients, and is of particular interest in the understanding of the mechanisms of weight loss.

Methods: Adults with obesity (mean age = 47.6 ± 11.8 years and BMI = 38.4 ± 4.9 kg/m2; 79.3% female; 54.0% non-Hispanic white; 44.7% black) were randomized to IBT-alone (n = 50), IBT-liraglutide (n = 50), or Multicomponent (n = 50). Results: At weeks 24 and 52, liraglutide-treated groups reported significantly larger declines in weight concern relative to the IBT-alone group. At week 24, compared with IBT-alone, liraglutide-treated groups reported significantly greater reductions in dietary disinhibition, global eating disorder psychopathology, and shape concern. The Multicomponent group had significantly greater reductions in binge eating at week 24 relative to the IBT-alone group. However, differences among groups were no longer significant at week 52. Groups did not differ in total food cravings at week 24 or 52.

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of six pharmacotherapies and lifestyle intervention for people with mild obesity (body mass indices [BMIs] 30 to 35). Methods: A microsimulation model was constructed to compare seven weight loss strategies plus no treatment: intensive lifestyle intervention, orlistat, phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, lorcaserin, liraglutide, and semaglutide. Weight loss, quality-of-life scores, and costs were estimated using clinical trials and other published literature. Endpoints included costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000/QALY. Results were analysed at 1-, 3-, and 5-year time horizons. Results: At each of the three follow-up periods, phentermine was the cost-effective strategy, with ICERs of $46 258/QALY, $20 157/QALY, and $17 880/QALY after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Semaglutide was the most effective strategy in the 3- and 5-year time horizons, with total QALYs of 2.224 and 3.711, respectively. However, the ICERs were prohibitively high at $1 437 340/QALY after 3 years and $576 931/QALY after 5 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated these results were robust. Conclusions: Phentermine is the cost-effective pharmacologic weight-loss strategy. Although semaglutide is the most effective, it is not cost-effective because of its high price. © 2019 The Authors.

The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, reduces cardiovascular events by poorly understood mechanisms. We investigated the effect of liraglutide combined with metformin on LGI and lipoprotein density profiles in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and newly diagnosed T2DM. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial over a 12 + 12-week period, with ≥2-week wash-out. Intervention: liraglutide/metformin vs. placebo/metformin. Lipoproteins were separated by continuous density gradient ultracentrifugation, and LDL divided into five subfractions between 226 and 270 Å, considering particle size ≤255 Å as the atherogenic pattern. Plasma C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor-α were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent-assay. Results: 28 out of 41 randomized patients completed all visits. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed but one patient had statin dosage and was excluded from the analysis. 95% of the patients were on statin therapy. Overall, liraglutide did not affect lipid subfractions or markers of LGI compared to placebo. The combination of liraglutide and metformin reduced the total LDL subfractions, primarily by reducing the most atherogenic subfraction LDL5, and reduced CRP but not TNF-α. Explorative analyses suggested that the subfraction LDL5 during the wash-out period rebounded significantly at least in a per-protocol analysis of the sub-group of patients starting the liraglutide therapy. Conclusions: In patients with CAD and newly diagnosed T2DM on stable statin therapy, liraglutide combined with metformin may improve the atherogenic LDL lipid profile and CRP. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","GLP-1; Lipoprotein; Liraglutide; Low-grade inflammation","Aged; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; C-Reactive Protein; Coronary Artery Disease; Cross-Over Studies; Denmark; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hypoglycemic Agents; Inflammation Mediators; Lipids; Liraglutide; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Obesity; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; C reactive protein; cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipoprotein; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; antidiabetic agent; autacoid; biological marker; C reactive protein; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipid; liraglutide; metformin; adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery disease; crossover procedure; density gradient centrifugation; double blind procedure; drug effect; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; intention to treat analysis; lipid fingerprinting; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obese patient; particle size; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; treatment duration; triacylglycerol level; aged; blood; combination drug therapy; coronary artery disease; Denmark; diagnostic imaging; drug effect; glucose blood level; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; time factor; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069506954"

Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way. Research design and methods: Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment. Results: Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group. Conclusions: Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cardio-vascular disease; Diabetes; Dyslipidemia; GLP-1; Lipoproteins; Liraglutide; Metabolites; Metabolomics; Obesity","Biomarkers; Boston; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Follistatin; Humans; Incretins; Inhibin-beta Subunits; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Lipoproteins; Liraglutide; Male; Obesity; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; activin A; behenic acid; docosahexaenoic acid; follistatin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; linoleic acid; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; monounsaturated fatty acid; myelopid; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; placebo; polyunsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; triacylglycerol; tyrosine; unsaturated fatty acid; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; biological marker; follistatin; FST protein, human; incretin; INHBB protein, human; inhibin; lipid; lipoprotein; liraglutide; Article; body weight loss; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; decreased appetite; double blind procedure; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug safety; fatty acid blood level; human; lipid metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; risk reduction; treatment duration; triacylglycerol blood level; blood; drug administration; drug effect; female; lipid metabolism; male; Massachusetts; obesity; time factor; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074439257"

The aim of the study was to evaluate the occurrence of early dumping in RYGB-operated individuals with PBH with and without treatment intervention. Methods: Eleven RYGB-operated women with documented PBH each underwent a baseline liquid mixed meal test (MMT) followed by five MMTs preceded by treatment with: acarbose 50 mg for 1 week, sitagliptin 100 mg for 1 week, verapamil 120 mg for 1 week, liraglutide 1.2 mg for 3 weeks, and pasireotide 300 μg as a single dose. Repetitive venous blood sampling and continuous electrocardiogram recordings were performed at fasting and during a 3-h postprandial period. Results: During the baseline MMT, there was a significant increase in HR (from 65 ± 2 to 90 ± 4 bpm, p < 0.0001) within 30 min after meal intake, while hypoglycemia occurred in the later postprandial period. The HR increase was accompanied by significant increases in serum albumin, plasma norepinephrine, blood glucose, serum insulin, and plasma GLP-1 concentrations. The postprandial HR changes were positively correlated with the changes in insulin and GLP-1 concentrations. Treatment with acarbose and pasireotide both reduced HR, plasma norepinephrine, and serum insulin, and pasireotide also decreased plasma GLP-1. Conclusions: RYGB-operated individuals with PBH also have large early postprandial HR increases, hemoconcentration, and sympathetic activation, consistent with early dumping. Moreover, hormone excursions associated with PBH appear to be related to measures of early dumping, suggesting a causal relationship between early dumping and PBH.

HRQoL was assessed using the obesity-specific Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) questionnaire, as well as the Short-Form 36 v2 (SF-36) health survey. At 3 years, mean change (±standard deviation) in IWQOL-Lite total score from baseline for liraglutide (n = 1472) was 11.0 ± 14.2, vs. 8.1 ± 14.7 for placebo (n = 738) (estimated treatment difference [ETD] 3.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0, 4.7], P < 0.0001).

Mean change in SF-36 mental component summary score did not significantly differ between groups. Both IWQOL-Lite total score and PCS score demonstrated an association between greater HRQoL improvement with higher weight loss.

Medications used to treat type 2 diabetes don't target inflammation therefore it's necessary to study how hypoglycemics can improve patient prognosis through modification of systemic inflammation. The aim: Our goal was to assess influence of liraglutide in complex therapy on proinflammatory cytokine levels in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes and compare it with metformin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Meterials and methods: The study included 80 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. We studied clinical parameters as well as antropometric: height, weight, BMI, abdomen circumference; hsCRP, proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) levels. Patients were treated according to an individualized treatment plan which included eating habit modification and dosed physical exercise. First and second groups were comparison groups. Patients in the first group received metformin as primary treatment up to 2500 mg/day (n=20). Patients in the second group received liraglutide up to 1.8 mg/day (n=30). Patients in the third (main) group received a combination of metformin (up to 2500 mg/day) and liraglutide up to 1.8 mg/day (n=30). RESULTS: Results and conclusions: Main group achieved a decrease in BMI from 28,48&#177;2,1 kg/m2 to 23,9&#177;1,8 kg/m2 (р<0,05), whereas such decrease in the liraglutide monotherapy group was from 28,59&#177;2,5 kg/m2 to 25,87&#177;2,3 kg/m2 (р<0,05) and from 28,65&#177;3,2 kg/m2 to 27,46&#177;2,8 kg/m2 (р>0,05) in the metformin monotherapy group. Liraglutide was more efficient in lowering inflammatory cytokine concentrations with TNF-α and IL-6 being more sensitive to its effects.

Liraglutide may be useful for weight management in adolescents with obesity. METHODS In this randomized, double-blind trial, which consisted of a 56-week treatment period and a 26-week follow-up period, we enrolled adolescents (12 to <18 years of age) with obesity and a poor response to lifestyle therapy alone. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide (3.0 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once daily, in addition to lifestyle therapy. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) standard-deviation score at week 56. RESULTS A total of 125 participants were assigned to the liraglutide group and 126 to the placebo group. Liraglutide was superior to placebo with regard to the change from baseline in the BMI standard-deviation score at week 56 (estimated difference, -0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.37 to -0.08; P = 0.002). A reduction in BMI of at least 5% was observed in 51 of 113 participants in the liraglutide group and in 20 of 105 participants in the placebo group (estimated percentage, 43.3% vs. 18.7%), and a reduction in BMI of at least 10% was observed in 33 and 9, respectively (estimated percentage, 26.1% vs. 8.1%). A greater reduction was observed with liraglutide than with placebo for BMI (estimated difference, -4.64 percentage points) and for body weight (estimated difference, -4.50 kg [for absolute change] and -5.01 percentage points [for relative change]). After discontinuation, a greater increase in the BMI standard-deviation score was observed with liraglutide than with placebo (estimated difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.23). More participants in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group had gastrointestinal adverse events (81 of 125 [64.8%] vs. 46 of 126 [36.5%]) and adverse events that led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (13 [10.4%] vs. 0). Few participants in either group had serious adverse events (3 [2.4%] vs. 5 [4.0%]). One suicide, which occurred in the liraglutide group, was assessed by the investigator as unlikely to be related to the trial treatment. CONCLUSIONS In adolescents with obesity, the use of liraglutide (3.0 mg) plus lifestyle therapy led to a significantly greater reduction in the BMI standard-deviation score than placebo plus lifestyle therapy.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics during short-term treatment with liraglutide in children (7-11 y) with obesity. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 24 children received at least one dose of once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (n = 16) or placebo (n = 8) starting at 0.3 mg with weekly dose escalations up to 3.0 mg or maximum tolerated dose, and 20 children completed the trial (14 in the liraglutide group and six in the placebo group). The primary endpoint was the number of adverse events. Results: Baseline characteristics (mean ± standard deviation) included the following: age 9.9 ± 1.1 years, weight 71.5 ± 15.4 kg, and 62.5% male. Thirty-seven adverse events were reported in nine liraglutide-treated participants (56.3%) versus 12 events in five placebo-treated participants (62.5%). Most adverse events were mild in severity, three were of moderate severity, and none were severe. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported events occurring in 37.5% of liraglutide-treated participants compared with placebo (12.5%). Six asymptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in five participants of whom four were liraglutide treated. Liraglutide exposure was consistent with dose proportionality. Body weight was the only covariate to significantly impact exposure. A significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) Z score from baseline to end of treatment (estimated treatment difference: −0.28; P = 0.0062) was observed. Conclusion: Short-term treatment with liraglutide in children with obesity revealed a safety and tolerability profile similar to trials in adults and adolescents with obesity, with no new safety issues. © 2019 The Authors.

Material and methods: This study involved post-hoc analyses of 4 controlled clinical trials, which assessed actions of GLP-1RA administration on kidney physiology. The immediate effects of GLP-1RA exenatide infusion vs placebo were determined in 9 healthy overweight men (Study-A) and in 52 overweight T2DM patients (Study-B). The effects of 12 weeks of long-acting GLP-1RA liraglutide vs placebo in 36 overweight T2DM patients (Study-C) and of 8 weeks of short-acting GLP-1RA lixisenatide vs once-daily titrated insulin glulisine in 35 overweight T2DM patients (Study-D) were also examined. Plasma UA, fractional (inulin-corrected) and absolute urinary excretion of UA (UEUA) and sodium (UENa), and urine pH were determined. Results: Median baseline plasma UA level was 5.39 to 6.33 mg/dL across all studies (17%-22% of subjects were hyperuricaemic). In Study-A, exenatide infusion slightly increased plasma UA (+0.07 ± 0.02 mg/dL, P =.04), and raised absolute-UEUA (+1.58 ± 0.65 mg/min/1.73 m2, P =.02), but did not affect fractional UEUA compared to placebo. Fractional UEUA and absolute UEUA correlated with increases in urine pH (r:0.86, P =.003 and r:0.92, P <.001, respectively). Fractional UEUA correlated with increased fractional UENa (r:0.76, P =.02). In Study-B, exenatide infusion did not affect plasma UA, but increased fractional UEUA (+0.76 ± 0.38%, P =.049) and absolute UEUA (+0.75 ± 0.27 mg/min/1.73 m2, P =.007), compared to placebo. In regression analyses, both parameters were explained by changes in urine pH and, in part, by changes in UENa. In Study-C, liraglutide treatment did not affect plasma UA, UEUA, UENa or urine pH, compared to placebo. In Study-D, lixisenatide treatment increased UENa and urine pH from baseline, but did not affect plasma UA or UEUA. Conclusion: Immediate exenatide infusion increases UEUA in overweight healthy men and in T2DM patients, probably by inhibiting Na+/H+-exchanger type-3 in the renal proximal tubule. Prolonged treatment with a long-acting or short-acting GLP-1RA does not affect plasma UA or UEUA in T2DM patients with normal plasma UA levels and at relatively low cardiovascular risk. Our results suggest that the cardio-renal benefits of GLP-1RA are not mediated through changes in UA. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","diabetic nephropathy; exenatide; GLP-1; liraglutide; randomised trial; type 2 diabetes","Adult; Aged; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Kidney; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Peptides; Renal Elimination; Renal Insufficiency; Uric Acid; Weight Loss; Young Adult; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin glulisine; liraglutide; lixisenatide; placebo; uric acid; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; GLP1R protein, human; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; insulin; insulin glulisine; lixisenatide; peptide; adult; Article; continuous infusion; controlled study; correlational study; diabetic patient; double blind procedure; drug effect; female; human; kidney function; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; post hoc analysis; randomized controlled trial; renal clearance; sodium urine level; treatment duration; uric acid blood level; uric acid urine level; urinary excretion; urine pH; aged; agonists; analogs and derivatives; blood; body mass; body weight loss; chemically induced; comparative study; complication; diabetic nephropathy; kidney; kidney failure; metabolism; obesity; pathophysiology; urine; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042172636"

Subjects/methods: Participants were 45 adults with obesity (75.6% female, 55.6% white, body mass index = 34.3 ± 4.7 kg/m2) who had lost an average of 12.6 ± 6.8% of initial weight during a prior 1-year randomized trial with liraglutide and intensive behavioral treatment. Participants were re-randomized, in a double-blinded fashion, to liraglutide 3.0 mg plus phentermine 15.0 mg (liraglutide-phentermine) or liraglutide plus placebo (liraglutide-placebo). Participants also were provided with four, 15-minute counseling sessions during the 12-week extension study. Results: At week 12, the liraglutide-phentermine and liraglutide-placebo groups lost a mean (±SEM) of 1.6 ± 0.6% and 0.1 ± 0.5% of re-randomization weight, respectively (p = 0.073). Two (9.1%) liraglutide-phentermine participants and one (4.3%) liraglutide-placebo participant lost ≥5% of re-randomization weight; 19 (86.4%) and 16 (69.9%) participants, respectively, maintained their full weight loss achieved in the prior 1-year trial (p = 0.125). Liraglutide-phentermine participants generally reported larger reductions in hunger and food preoccupation than liraglutide-placebo participants during the first 8 weeks of the extension study. Conclusions: The combination of liraglutide and phentermine appeared to be well-tolerated but did not produce additional clinically meaningful weight loss in individuals who had already lost 12.6% of initial weight with liraglutide alone.

The risk depends significantly on adipose tissue distribution. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analog, is associatedwithweight loss, improved glycemic control, and reduced cardiovascular risk.We determined whether an equal degree of weight loss by liraglutide or lifestyle changes has a different impact on subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in obese subjects with prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Sixty-two metformin-treated obese subjects with prediabetes or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, were randomized to liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) or lifestyle counseling. Changes in SAT and VAT levels (determined by abdominal MRI), insulin sensitivity (according to the Matsuda index), and β-cell function (β-index) were assessed during a multiple-sampling oral glucose tolerance test; and circulating levels of IGF-I and IGF-II were assessed before and after a comparable weight loss (7% of initial body weight). RESULTS After comparable weight loss, achieved by 20 patients per arm, and superimposable glycemic control, as reflected by HbA1c level (P = 0.60), reduction in VAT was significantly higher in the liraglutide arm than in the lifestyle arm (P = 0.028), in parallel with a greater improvement in β-index (P = 0.021). No differences were observed in SAT reduction (P = 0.64). IGF-II serum levels were significantly increased (P = 0.024) only with liraglutide administration, and the increase in IGF-II levels correlated with both a decrease in VAT (ρ = 20.435, P = 0.056) and an increase in the β-index (ρ = 0.55, P = 0.012).

We aimed to study the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 in patients with schizophrenia under treatment with SGAs. Methods: Diabetic patients with schizophrenia were included if their HbA1c levels increased more than 1% and/or their weight increased more than 3 kg after treatment with SGAs. Patients who developed diabetes after treatment with SGAs were also included. The participants were treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists for one year, and their changes in weight and HbA1c and any adverse events were evaluated. Results: Seven patients were treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists; their mean age was 46.1 yrs old (range; 26 to 59), mean body weight was 85.3 kg (65.5 to 96.8), and mean BMI was 33.8 (27 to 38.7). Five of them showed improvement in their HbA1c levels of 1.2% (0.1 to 3.4, p=0.089) with a weight loss of 3.7 kg (-9.6 to +3.5, p=0.14) on average. The adverse effects observed were all gastrointestinal, but were not severe enough to cause termination of the GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment. The GLP-1 receptor agonist was not effective in one patient, and another patient terminated the treatment in a few months. Conclusions: Although the number of patients studied was small, GLP-1 receptor agonists seem to be effective for treating diabetes and bringing about weight loss in patients with schizophrenia under treatment with SGAs. © 2018, Nagasaki University School of Medicine.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of weight loss and weight maintenance with and without liraglutide treatment on plasma lipid profiles and apoB. Methods: Fifty-eight individuals with obesity (body mass index 34.5 ± 3.0 kg/m2 [mean ± SD]) were included in this study. After 8 weeks on a very low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day), participants were randomized to weight maintenance with meal replacements with or without liraglutide (1.2 mg daily) for 1 year. Plasma samples from before and after weight loss and after 1 year of weight maintenance were subjected to nuclear magnetic resonance-based lipidomics analysis. Results: After an 8-week low-calorie diet, study participants lost 12.0 ± 2.9 kg (mean ± SD) of their body weight, which was reflected in their lipid profiles (80 out of 124 lipids changed significantly), including reduced levels of apoB, total cholesterol, free cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein subclasses. After 1 year of maintained weight loss, the majority of the lipids had returned to pre-weight loss levels even though weight loss was successfully maintained in both groups. Interestingly, apoB levels remained low in the liraglutide treated group (apoB change: 0.03 ± 0.02 mmol/L, p = 0.4) in contrast to an increase in the control group (apoB change: 0.06 ± 0.07 mmol/L, p = 0.02). Conclusion: An 8-week low-calorie diet, in individuals with obesity, reduced plasma levels of lipids and the atherogenic marker apoB. After 1 year of weight maintenance, only study participants treated with liraglutide maintained reduced levels of apoB, despite similar body weight maintenance. Treatment with liraglutide may therefore reduce apoB levels and thus reflect lower CVD risk. Including apoB measurements in clinical practice when monitoring patients with dislipidemia or CVD might prove to be useful. © 2017 The Authors.

However, the bottleneck for the therapeutic application of many peptides and proteins is their short halflives in vivo, typically just a few minutes to hours. Half-life extension strategies have been extensively studied and many of them have been proven to be effective in the generation of long-acting therapeutics with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in half-life extension strategies, illustrate their potential applications and give some examples, highlighting the strategies that have been used in approved drugs and for drugs in clinical trials. Meanwhile, several novel strategies that are still in the process of discovery or at a preclinical stage are also introduced. In these strategies, the two most frequently used half-life extension methods are the reduction in the rate of renal clearance or the exploitation of the recycling mechanism of FcRn by binding to the albumin or IgG-Fc. Here, we discuss half-life extension strategies of recombinant therapeutic protein via genetic fusion, rather than chemical conjugation such as PEGylation. With the rapid development of genetic engineering and protein engineering, novel strategies for half-life extension have been emerged consistently. Some of these will be evaluated in clinical trials and may become viable alternatives to current strategies for making next-generation biodrugs. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","FcRn; Half-life extension strategies; Long-acting; Peptides and proteins; Pharmacodynamic properties; Renal clearance","Animals; Genetic Engineering; Humans; Life Expectancy; Peptides; Protein Engineering; Proteins; abatacept; affibody molecule; aflibercept; albiglutide; albumin; albumin binding domain antibody; alefacept; belatacept; corifollitropin alfa; cytidine triphosphate; designed ankyrin repeat protein; drug carrier; dulaglutide; etanercept; Fc receptor; heavy chain complementary determining region 3; immunoglobulin G; insulin degludec; insulin detemir; liraglutide; nanobody; polypeptide; recombinant blood clotting factor 8; recombinant blood clotting factor 9; recombinant erythropoietin; rilonacept; romiplostim; semaglutide; transferrin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; peptide; protein; albumin binding domain; anemia; Article; binding affinity; chemical modification; CINCA syndrome; diabetes mellitus; drug half life; female infertility; gene fusion; glycosylation; hemophilia A; hemophilia B; human; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; kidney graft rejection; lipidation; macular degeneration; metastatic colorectal cancer; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; PEGylation; priority journal; protein domain; protein purification; psoriasis vulgaris; renal clearance; rheumatoid arthritis; animal; genetic engineering; genetics; life expectancy; metabolism; protein engineering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064263867"

Participants were randomized to liraglutide or a comparator group (placebo or orlistat). The objective was to evaluate whether cardiovascular risk was increased with liraglutide treatment. The primary composite outcome of this time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke. These cardiovascular events were adjudicated prospectively for three of the trials and retrospectively for two trials by an event adjudication committee. The primary outcome was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by trial. With liraglutide 3.0 mg, 8 participants had positively adjudicated cardiovascular events (1.54 events/1000 person-years) compared to 10 participants in the comparators group (3.65 events/1000 person-years). The hazard ratio for liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to comparators was 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.17-1.08). In this analysis, liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment was not associated with excess cardiovascular risk.

Methods: Thirty obese (mean age 40.7 ± 9.1 years, BMI 33.2 ± 3.6 kg/m                             2                             , 90% male) adults with NAFLD defined as liver fat fraction (LFF) > 5% on magnetic resonance imaging without other causes of hepatic steatosis were randomized to a supervised programme of energy restriction plus moderate-intensity exercise to induce ≥ 5% weight loss (DE group, n = 15), or liraglutide 3 mg daily (LI group, n = 15) for 26 weeks, followed by 26 weeks with only advice to prevent weight regain. Results: Diet and exercise and LI groups had significant (P < 0.01) and similar reductions in weight (−3.5 ± 3.3 vs −3.0 ± 2.2 kg), LFF (−8.1 ± 13.2 vs −7.0 ± 7.1%), serum alanine aminotransferase (−39 ± 35 vs −26 ± 33 U/L) and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 (cCK-18) (−206 ± 252 vs −130 ± 158 U/L) at 26 weeks.

Obesity accelerates renal functional decline in people with T2DM. Intentional weight loss (IWL) strategies in this population hold promise as a means of arresting DKD progression. In the present paper, we summarize the impact of IWL strategies (stratified by lifestyle intervention, medications, and metabolic surgery) on renal outcomes in obese people with DKD. We reviewed the Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases for relevant randomized control trials and observational studies published between August 1, 2018 and April 15, 2019. We found that IWL improves renal outcomes in the setting of DKD and obesity. Rate of progression of DKD slows with IWL, but varying outcome measures among studies makes direct comparison difficult. Furthermore, established means of estimating renal function are imperfect owing to loss of lean muscle mass with IWL strategies. The choice of optimal IWL strategy needs to be individualized; future work should establish the comparative efficacy of IWL strategies in obese people with DKD to better inform such decisions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","albuminuria; bariatric surgery; biomarkers; diabetic kidney disease; obesity; type 2 diabetes mellitus; weight loss","Albuminuria; Anti-Obesity Agents; Bariatric Surgery; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; Humans; Life Style; Obesity; Weight Loss; Weight Reduction Programs; creatinine; cystatin C; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; tumor necrosis factor receptor; antiobesity agent; albuminuria; Article; bariatric surgery; body weight loss; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; creatinine blood level; developed country; diabetic nephropathy; diet therapy; disease exacerbation; end stage renal disease; estimated glomerular filtration rate; gastric banding; gastric bypass surgery; health care system; human; kidney function; lifestyle modification; longitudinal study; major clinical study; muscle mass; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; sleeve gastrectomy; systemic disease; complication; diabetic nephropathy; lifestyle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; weight loss program","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068516192"

The aims of this study were to investigate whether serum ANGPTL8 level in patients with T2DM was affected by treatment with exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, and to determine whether and how GLP-1R agonists regulated ANGPTL8 production in hepatocytes. A multiple-center trial was conducted in China. Among 240 patients with T2DM enrolled in this trial, 195 patients adhered to a 16-week exenatide treatment and follow-up. Human liver cell line HepG2 cells were incubated for 24 h with either exendin-4 (a native form of exenatide) or liraglutide in the presence or absence of GLP-1R antagonist exendin (9–39) and PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Change of serum ANGPTL8 level in patients with T2DM and regulation of ANGPTL8 production by the GLP-1R agonists in HepG2 cells were evaluated. Results showed that compared with baseline, exenatide treatment significantly increased serum ANGPTL8 level, and lowered body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with T2DM (all P < 0.05). The exenatide treatment-mediated upregulation of serum ANGPTL8 level was not associated with the levels of its lowering effects on body weight, FBG and HbA1c stratified by the median. Moreover, exendin-4 or liraglutide dose-dependently upregulated the level of ANGPTL8 expression and secretion in HepG2 cells, which was eliminated by adding exendin (9–39) and LY294002. In conclusion, GLP-1R agonists enhance ANGPTL8 production in vivo and in vitro, which is mediated via the PI3K/Akt pathway in a GLP-1R-dependent manner. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Angiopoietin-like protein 8; Glucagon-like peptide-1; Hepatocytes; Type 2 diabetes","Adult; Aged; Angiopoietin-like Proteins; China; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Exenatide; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatocytes; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Peptide Hormones; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; 2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; angiopoietin like protein 8; angiopoietin related protein; exendin 4; exendin 9; exendin 9 39; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucagon like peptide 1 [7-36] amide; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; unclassified drug; angiopoietin related protein; ANGPTL8 protein, human; antidiabetic agent; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; peptide hormone; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; add on therapy; adult; Article; body mass; body weight; controlled study; diabetic patient; diastolic blood pressure; dose response; female; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver cell; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; middle aged; multicenter study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient compliance; Pi3K/Akt signaling; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; protein secretion; treatment duration; upregulation; aged; agonists; blood; China; clinical trial; drug effect; liver cell; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049895550"

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)d defined as coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes and results in an estimated $37.3 billion in cardiovascular-related spending per year associated with diabetes (1). Common conditions coexisting with type 2 diabetes (e.g., hypertension and dyslipidemia) are clear risk factors for ASCVD, and diabetes it self confers independent risk. Numerous studies have shown the efficacy of controlling individual cardiovascular risk factors in preventing or slowing ASCVD in people with diabetes. Furthermore, large benefits are seen when multiplecar diovascular risk factors are add ressed simultaneously. Under the current paradigm of aggressive risk factor modification in patients with diabetes, there is evidence that measures of 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk among U.S. adults with diabetes have improved significantly over the past decade (2) and that ASCVD morbidity and mortality have decreased(3,4). Heart failure is another major cause of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have found that rates of incident heart failure hospitalization (adjustedforageandsex) were two foldhig her in patients with diabetes compared with those without (5,6). People with diabetes may have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Hypertension is often a precursor of heart failure of either type, and ASCVD can coexist with either type (7), whereas prior myocardial infarction (MI) is often a major factor in HFrEF. Rates of heart failure hospitalization have been improved in recent trials including patients with type 2 diabetes, most of whom also had ASCVD, with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (8–10). © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Angiopathies; Endocrinology; Heart Disease Risk Factors; History, 21st Century; Humans; Reference Standards; Societies, Medical; Standard of Care; United States; acetylsalicylic acid; albiglutide; alirocumab; angiotensin receptor antagonist; calcium channel blocking agent; canagliflozin; clopidogrel; dapagliflozin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; empagliflozin; evolocumab; exendin 4; ezetimibe; fenofibrate; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; icosapentaenoic acid; indapamide plus perindopril; labetalol; laropiprant plus nicotinic acid; liraglutide; lixisenatide; methyldopa; nifedipine; prasugrel; semaglutide; simvastatin; thiazide diuretic agent; ticagrelor; acute kidney failure; albuminuria; Article; bedtime dosage; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure regulation; caloric intake; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney failure; clinical practice; cognition; coronary artery atherosclerosis; diastolic blood pressure; diet restriction; disease severity; dyslipidemia; family history; health care quality; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; high risk patient; human; hyperkalemia; hypertension; incidence; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lifestyle modification; low drug dose; maternal hypertension; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physical activity; practice guideline; prevalence; primary prevention; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; risk management; risk reduction; secondary prevention; smoking; sodium intake; systolic blood pressure; treatment duration; treatment outcome; cardiovascular disease; diabetes mellitus; diabetic angiopathy; endocrinology; history; medical society; organization and management; procedures; standard; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077048167"

Methods: A cross-sectional study assessing the presence of prediabetes and metabolic abnormalities in schizophrenia clozapine- or olanzapine-treated patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2. Procedures were part of the screening process for a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating liraglutide vs placebo for improving glucose tolerance. For comparison, an age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy control group without psychiatric illness and prediabetes was included. Prediabetes was defined as elevated fasting plasma glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and/or elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c. Results: Among 145 schizophrenia patients (age = 42.1 years; males = 59.3%) on clozapine or olanzapine (clozapine/olanzapine/both: 73.8%/24.1%/2.1%), prediabetes was present in 69.7% (101 out of 145). While schizophrenia patients with and without prediabetes did not differ regarding demographic, illness, or antipsychotic treatment variables, metabolic abnormalities (waist circumference: 116.7±13.7 vs 110.1±13.6 cm, P = 0.007; triglycerides: 2.3±1.4 vs 1.6±0.9 mmol/L, P = 0.0004) and metabolic syndrome (76.2% vs 40.9%, P<0.0001) were significantly more pronounced in schizophrenia patients with vs without prediabetes. The age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy controls had significantly better glucose tolerance compared to both groups of patients with schizophrenia. The healthy controls also had higher levels of high-density lipoprotein compared to patients with schizophrenia and prediabetes. Conclusion: Prediabetes and metabolic abnormalities were highly prevalent among the clozapine- and olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia, putting these patients at great risk for later type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These results stress the importance of identifying and adequately treating prediabetes and metabolic abnormalities among clozapine- and olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.","Antipsychotic; glucose metabolism; metabolic syndrome; prediabetes; schizophrenia","clozapine; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; liraglutide; olanzapine; placebo; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; Article; body mass; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; double blind procedure; drug safety; female; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; hemoglobin blood level; human; impaired glucose tolerance; major clinical study; male; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; schizophrenia; treatment duration; waist circumference","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069738710"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of treatment with liraglutide on energy metabolism and BAT fat fraction in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods and results: In a 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 50 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to treatment with liraglutide (1.8 mg/day) or placebo added to standard care. At baseline and after treatment for 4, 12 and 26 weeks, we assessed resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry. Furthermore, at baseline and after 26 weeks, we determined the fat fraction in the supraclavicular BAT depot using chemical-shift water-fat MRI at 3T. Liraglutide reduced REE after 4 weeks, which persisted after 12 weeks and tended to be present after 26 weeks (week 26 vs baseline: liraglutide −52 ± 128 kcal/day; P = 0.071, placebo +44 ± 144 kcal/day; P = 0.153, between group P = 0.057). Treatment with liraglutide for 26 weeks did not decrease the fat fraction in supraclavicular BAT (−0.4 ± 1.7%; P = 0.447) compared to placebo (−0.4 ± 1.4%; P = 0.420; between group P = 0.911). Conclusion: Treatment with liraglutide decreases REE in the first 12 weeks and tends to decrease this after 26 weeks without affecting the fat fraction in the supraclavicular BAT depot. These findings suggest reduction in energy intake rather than an increase in REE to contribute to the liraglutide-induced weight loss.

Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist, facilitates weight loss in obese patients. The efficacy of liraglutide as a weight loss agent among patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and a recent acute HF hospitalization remains unknown. Methods and results: The Functional Impact of GLP-1 for Heart Failure Treatment study randomized 300 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction ≤ 40%), both with and without diabetes and a recent HF hospitalization to liraglutide or placebo. The primary outcome for this post hoc analysis was the change in weight from baseline to last study visit. We conducted an ‘on-treatment’ analysis of patients with at least one follow-up visit on study drug (123 on liraglutide and 124 on placebo). The median age was 61 years, 21% were female, and 69% of patients had New York Heart Association functional Class III or IV symptoms. The median ejection fraction was 25% (25th, 75th percentile 19–32%). Liraglutide use was associated with a significant weight reduction [liraglutide −1.00 lbs vs. placebo 2.00 lbs; treatment difference −4.10 lbs; 95% confidence interval (CI) −7.94, −0.25; P = 0.0367; percentage treatment difference −2.07%, 95% CI −3.86, −0.28; P = 0.0237]. Similar results were seen after multivariable adjustments. Liraglutide also significantly reduced triglyceride levels (liraglutide 7.5 mg/dL vs. placebo 12.0 mg/dL; treatment difference −33.1 mg/dL; 95% CI −60.7, −5.6; P = 0.019). Conclusions: Liraglutide is an efficacious weight loss agent in patients with HFrEF.

However, their comparative efficacy in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in class I obese patients specifically in Indian has not been studied yet. This study evaluates and compares the efficacy and side effect of surgical and advanced medical management of T2DM in class I obese patients. Methods: T2DM patients with body mass index ranging from 30 to 35 kg/m2 and with a median duration of 3 years and HbA1c level >7.5% were recruited for the study. Selection of treatment option that is bariatric surgery, GLP-1 analogues and SGLT2 inhibitor, was kept on patient’s choice. Each group had 30 patients after 12 months of follow-up. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, and lipid profile levels were assessed at baseline and after 12 months of follow-up. Results: There was statistically significant lowering of HbA1c and FPG after 12 months in all the three groups. However, this lowering was clinically insignificant in GLP-1 and SGLT2 groups. There was also improvement in lipid profile values in all the three groups with significantly higher percentage change in bariatric surgery group when compared to other modalities. Conclusions: Bariatric surgery is a safe and effective procedure to treat T2DM in class I obese patients. It is also superior to advance medical treatment modalities such as GLP-1 analogues and SGLT2 inhibitors. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bariatric surgery; Class I obesity; GLP-1 analogues; SGLT2 inhibitor","Adult; Bariatric Surgery; Body Mass Index; Combined Modality Therapy; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; Treatment Outcome; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; incretin; SLC5A2 protein, human; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; cholesterol blood level; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; comparative effectiveness; diabetic obesity; female; follow up; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; morning dosage; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; priority journal; prospective study; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; triacylglycerol blood level; analogs and derivatives; antagonists and inhibitors; bariatric surgery; blood; body mass; clinical trial; complication; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; procedures; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020660660"

Two of these medications, liraglutide and semaglutide, appear to have cardioprotective effects as reflected in cardiovascular outcomes studies. The GLP-1 RAs are associated with gastrointestinal side effects that tend to diminish over time. They have very low risk of hypoglycemia unless used in conjunction with insulin or insulin secretagogues. Two coformulations of GLP-1 RAs together with long-acting basal insulin are available for daily use. The original GLP-1 RA, exenatide, requires twice-daily injections; two short-acting analogs are given once daily. Three currently available long-acting GLP-1 RAs are injected once weekly, providing greater convenience and potentially improving patient adherence. Semaglutide appears to be the most effective in terms of HbA1c reduction and weight loss. GLP-1 RAs can be combined with all classes of antihyperglycemic agents except DPP-4 inhibitors. Current studies are exploring the use of an implantable osmotic pump for long-term administration of a rapid acting analog (exenatide), an oral preparation of semaglutide, benefits for management of obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and mechanisms of cardioprotective effects. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Cardiovascular outcome trials; Clinical trials; GLP-1 receptor agonists; Pharmacotherapy; Type 2 diabetes","Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Therapy, Combination; Exenatide; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin, Long-Acting; Treatment Outcome; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; hemoglobin A1c; insulin degludec plus liraglutide; insulin glargine plus lixisenatide; liraglutide; lixisenatide; semaglutide; antidiabetic agent; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; long acting insulin; Article; body weight loss; cardiovascular disease; clinical evaluation; clinical trial (topic); diabetes mellitus; drug effect; drug formulation; drug mechanism; heart muscle ischemia; heart protection; human; long term care; managed care; meta analysis (topic); non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; obesity management; outcome assessment; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); agonists; analogs and derivatives; blood; combination drug therapy; glucose blood level; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048891076"

The aim of this study was to determine whether glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), used as antihyperglycemic agents for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) management, may reduce salt cravings as they are known to reduce hedonic feeding behavior and are involved in sodium homeostasis by increasing renal sodium excretion. Methods: We performed exploratory analyses using data from two randomized, clinical crossover trials, which primarily aimed to assess the effects of GLP-1 RAs on central satiety and reward circuits and subsequent related feeding behavior. In study A, healthy, obese individuals and patients with T2DM were randomly assigned to receive intravenous administration of placebo or GLP-1 RA exenatide with or without concurrent GLP-1 receptor blockade, on separate testing days. In study B, individuals with T2DM randomly received GLP-1 RA liraglutide (titrated up to 1.8 mg daily) or titrated insulin glargine for 12 wk. In both studies, participants received an ad libitum mixed meal that served to calculate sodium intake. Moreover, salt craving was scored using a Likert scale. Results: In study A, acute exenatide, parallel to reduced total food intake, reduced sodium intake in all studied groups by up to 30%. In study B, prolonged liraglutide treatment did not affect sodium or total caloric intake. Neither acute exenatide nor prolonged liraglutide treatment affected salt craving as measured by the Likert scale. Conclusion: Acute exenatide reduced sodium intake in light of a generalized reduction in food ingestion, while prolonged intervention with liraglutide did not lower sodium intake. Neither intervention affected salt craving. Given the known effects of these drugs on renal sodium excretion, blood pressure, and renal and cardiovascular outcome, it seems plausible to perform dedicated mechanistic studies in humans to assess the effects of GLP-1 RA administration on sodium balance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Diet; Feeding behaviour; GLP-1 receptor agonists; Sodium intake; Type 2 diabetes","Adult; Aged; Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Eating; Exenatide; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sodium, Dietary; exendin 4; insulin glargine; liraglutide; placebo; antidiabetic agent; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; adult; Article; calculation; caloric intake; clinical article; controlled study; craving; drug dose increase; drug dose titration; drug effect; feeding behavior; female; food intake; homeostasis; human; Likert scale; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; salt craving; satiety; sodium excretion; sodium intake; aged; crossover procedure; eating; middle aged; obesity; randomized controlled trial (topic); sodium intake","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073666357"

Weight loss is considered a primary management strategy in patients with concomitant overweight and knee OA. However, there are no widely available and feasible methods to sustain weight loss in patients with overweight and knee OA. The present protocol describes a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide in a 3 mg/day dosing in patients with overweight and knee OA. Methods and analysis 150 volunteer adult patients with overweight or obesity and knee OA will participate in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and single-centre trial. The participants will partake in a run-in diet intervention phase (week-8 to 0) including a low calorie diet and dietetic counselling. At week 0, patients will be randomised to either liraglutide 3 mg/day or liraglutide placebo 3 mg/day for 52 weeks as an add-on to dietetic guidance on re-introducing regular foods and a focus on continued motivation to engage in a healthy lifestyle. The co-primary outcomes are changes in body weight and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score pain subscale from week 0 to week 52. Ethics and dissemination The trial has been approved by the regional ethics committee in the Capital Region of Denmark, the Danish Medicines Agency and the Danish Data Protection Agency. An external monitoring committee (The Good Clinical Practice Unit at Copenhagen University Hospitals) will oversee the trial. The results will be presented at international scientific meetings and through publications in peer-reviewed journals.

We compared effects of liraglutide versus placebo on gastric motor functions, satiation, satiety, and weight in obese individuals over 16 weeks. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial at a single centre (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) by a computer generated randomisation schedule with no stratification to receive subcutaneous liraglutide (3·0 mg) or placebo, with standardised nutritional and behavioural counselling. Allocation was concealed from participants and study investigators. Otherwise healthy, local residents aged 18–65 years with body-mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2 or higher were included. Liraglutide or placebo was escalated by 0·6 mg/day each week for 5 weeks and continued until week 16. The primary outcome was change in gastric emptying (delay relative to baseline) of solids T1/2 (time taken for half the radiolabelled meal to empty from the stomach), measured at 5 weeks and 16 weeks in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug, with missing data imputed. Secondary outcomes included weight loss at weeks 5 and 16, satiation (volume to fullness and maximum tolerated volume), satiety, and fasting and postprandial gastric volumes at 16 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02647944, and is closed to new participants. Findings Between Dec 18, 2015, and Sept 1, 2016, 40 adults were enrolled and randomly allocated (19 to the liraglutide group; 21 to the placebo group). Compared with placebo, liraglutide delayed gastric emptying of solids at 5 weeks (median 70 min [IQR 32 to 151] vs 4 min [–21 to 18]; p<0·0001) and 16 weeks (30·5 min [–11 to 54] vs −1 min [–19 to 7]; p=0·025). There was also significantly greater weight loss in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (at 5 weeks: median 3·7 kg [IQR 2·8 to 4·8] vs 0·6 kg [–0·3 to 1·4], p<0·0001; at 16 weeks: 5·3 kg [5·2 to 6·8] vs 2·5 kg [0·1 to 4·2], p=0·0009). Satiation, as assessed by maximum tolerated volume at 16 weeks, was lower in the liraglutide group (median 750 mL [IQR 651 to 908]) compared with the placebo group (1126 mL [944–1185]; p=0·054). No significant differences were noted between groups in terms of volume to fullness, satiety, or fasting and postprandial gastric volumes at week 16. Post-hoc analysis showed that the T1/2 of gastric emptying of solids at 5 weeks correlated with change in weight loss at week 16 with liraglutide (Rs 0·567, p=0·018). Nausea was the most common adverse event in the liraglutide group (12 of 19) compared with placebo (four of 21). Interpretation Effects of liraglutide on weight loss are associated with delay in gastric emptying of solids; measurement of gastric emptying (eg, at 5 weeks of treatment) may be a biomarker of responsiveness and may help to select individuals for prolonged treatment with this class of drug.

They are generally more selective in their mechanism of action, thereby potentially minimising adverse sequelae and improving the risk-benefit ratio of pharmacotherapy. Another approach has been to use combined pharmacotherapy to better counteract the multiple counter-regulatory neuroendocrine mechanisms which promote weight regain, as well as allowing lower constituent doses of the combined monotherapy agents, which improves the safety and tolerability of these agents that are usually required long-term for chronic weight maintenance.This review will provide an overview of past, present and future pharmacotherapy for obesity. The efficacy and safety profile of currently available pharmacotherapy will be discussed in the setting of stringent regulatory review processes now in place given the fraught history of pharmacological interventions for obesity. Potential novel therapies that seek to better target the multiple complex counter-regulatory mechanisms promoting weight regain while improving the efficacy/safety profile, will also be examined. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Obesity; Pharmacotherapy; Review","Anti-Obesity Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Neurosecretory Systems; Obesity; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; antiobesity agent; beloranib; cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonist; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; liraglutide; lorcaserin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; mirabegron; neuropeptide Y5 receptor; phentermine; placebo; tesofensine; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; antiobesity agent; Article; bariatric surgery; caloric restriction; cholesterol blood level; clinical trial (topic); combination chemotherapy; constipation; diarrhea; dizziness; dosage schedule comparison; dose response; drug dose escalation; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug safety; headache; human; hypoglycemia; insomnia; intermethod comparison; lifestyle modification; low drug dose; monotherapy; nausea and vomiting; obesity; paresthesia; priority journal; treatment duration; weight reduction; xerostomia; adverse effects; combination drug therapy; drug effects; neurosecretion; obesity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951568463"

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and insulin secretion impairment leading to hyperglycemia. The presence of insulin resistance is strongly correlated with obesity. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the available glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and their role in the management of patients with diabetes, to help guide the selection of the most suitable agent for the individualized treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. DISCUSSION: This article reviews the evidence from phase 3 clinical trials for each of the 5 GLP-1 receptor agonists by comparing them against one another and with other existing therapies, including metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and sulfonylureas. Incretin-based therapies have emerged as attractive agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They target the GLP-1 hormone, which is partly responsible for insulin release and for attenuating hyperglycemia during meals (ie, the incretin ef-fect). The 2 classes of incretin-based therapy currently available are GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, which prevent the breakdown of GLP-1. Both classes are attractive options, given their glucose-lowering effects without the adverse effects of hypoglycemia and weight gain. The different mechanisms of action of these therapies result in generally greater efficacy with GLP-1 receptor agonists, albeit at the expense of slightly increased gastrointestinal symptoms. These agents exert their effects by improving glucose-dependent insulin release, suppressing glucagon release, suppressing hepatic glucose output, and decreasing the rate of gastric emptying, thereby reducing appetite. Currently, 5 GLP-1 receptor agonists are available, including exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, and lixisenatide; semaglutide may soon become available as the newest agent. With the exception of the investigational oral semaglutide, which has shown promising results, the other 5 agents are administered as subcutaneous injections, at different dosing intervals. CONCLUSION: Currently, 5 GLP-1 receptor agonists are available for use in the United States. Although they are all in the same drug class, some significant differences exist among the various GLP-1 receptor agonists. The choice of a specific GLP-1 receptor agonist will depend on the patient preferences, potential adverse effects, and cost. © 2017 by Engage Healthcare Communications, LLC.","Albiglutide; Diabetes; DPP-4 inhibitors; Dulaglutide; Exenatide; GLP-1 receptor agonists; Incretin-based therapy; Insulin; Liraglutide; Lixisenatide; Metformin; Semaglutide; Sulfonylureas; Type 2 diabetes","adiponectin; albiglutide; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glimepiride; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; incretin; insulin glargine; insulin glargine plus lixisenatide; leptin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; metformin; pioglitazone; resistin; semaglutide; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea derivative; tumor necrosis factor; antibody production; Article; clinical trial (topic); cost effectiveness analysis; diarrhea; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; immunocytotoxicity; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin response; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient preference; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); renal clearance; vomiting; weight gain; weight reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85024090971"

We used the baseline data of liraglutide effect and action in diabetes: evaluation of CV outcome results-A long term Evaluation (LEADER) (a clinical trial to assess the CV safety of liraglutide) to investigate: (i) prevalence of overweight and obesity; (ii) relationship of the major cardiometabolic risk factors with anthropometric measures of adiposity [body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC)]; and (iii) cardiometabolic treatment intensity in relation to BMI and WC. Methods: LEADER enrolled two distinct populations of high-risk patients with T2DM in 32 countries: (1) aged ≥50 years with prior CV disease; (2) aged ≥60 years with one or more CV risk factors. Associations of metabolic variables, demographic variables and treatment intensity with anthropometric measurements (BMI and WC) were explored using regression models (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01179048). Results: Mean BMI was 32.5 ± 6.3 kg/m2 and only 9.1 % had BMI <25 kg/m2. The prevalence of healthy WC was also extremely low (6.4 % according to International Joint Interim Statement for the Harmonization of the Metabolic Syndrome criteria). Obesity was associated with being younger, female, previous smoker, Caucasian, American, with shorter diabetes duration, uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), antihypertensive agents, insulin plus oral antihyperglycaemic treatment, higher levels of triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conclusions: Overweight and obesity are prevalent in high CV risk patients with T2DM. BMI and WC are related to the major cardiometabolic risk factors. Furthermore, treatment intensity, such as insulin, statins or oral antihypertensive drugs, is higher in those who are overweight or obese; while BP and lipid control in these patients are remarkably suboptimal. LEADER confers a unique opportunity to explore the longitudinal effect of weight on CV risk factors and hard endpoints. © 2016 Masmiquel et al.","Cardiometabolic; Cardiovascular; LEADER; Liraglutide; Obesity; Overweight; Type 2 diabetes","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Waist Circumference; antihypertensive agent; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; liraglutide; oral antidiabetic agent; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; abdominal obesity; adult; age; aged; American; Article; blood pressure regulation; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; disease duration; drug effect; drug safety; drug use; female; gender; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prevalence; smoking; triacylglycerol blood level; waist circumference; Cardiovascular Diseases; clinical trial; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; double blind procedure; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; multicenter study; obesity; phase 3 clinical trial; prevalence; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957894002"

Surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity calculated from insulin and glucose concentrations at fasting or after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are frequently used, but have not been validated after RYGB. Our aim was to evaluate whether surrogate indices reliably estimate changes in insulin sensitivity after RYGB. Four fasting (inverse-HOMA-IR, HOMA2-%S, QUICKI, revised-QUICKI) and three OGTT-derived surrogates (Matsuda, Gutt, OGIS) were compared with HEC-estimated peripheral insulin sensitivity (Rd or Rd/I, depending on how the index was originally validated) and the tracer-determined hepatic insulin sensitivity index (HISI) in patients with preoperative type 2 diabetes (n=10) and normal glucose tolerance (n=10) 1 week, 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. Post-RYGB changes in inverse-HOMA-IR and HOMA2-%S did not correlate with changes in Rd at any visit, but were comparable to changes in HISI at 1 week. Changes in QUICKI and revised-QUICKI correlated with Rd/I after surgery. Changes in Matsuda and Gutt did not correlate with changes in Rd/I and Rd, respectively, whereas OGIS-changes correlated with Rd-changes at 1 year post-RYGB. In conclusion, surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity may not reflect results obtained with gold standard methodology after RYGB, underscoring the importance of critical reflection when surrogate endpoints are used. Fasting surrogate indices may be particularly affected by post-RYGB changes in insulin clearance, whereas the validity of OGTT-derived surrogates may be compromised by the surgical rearrangements of the gut. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","Bariatric surgery; Hepatic insulin sensitivity; HOMA-IR; Matsuda; OGIS; Peripheral insulin sensitivity; QUICKI","Adult; Blood Glucose; Female; Gastric Bypass; Glucose Clamp Technique; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Obesity, Morbid; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Treatment Outcome; C peptide; gastrointestinal hormone; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; isophane insulin; liraglutide; metformin; glucose blood level; insulin; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical evaluation; combination drug therapy; controlled study; correlation coefficient; diabetic patient; diet restriction; disease assessment; female; glucose tolerance; glycemic control; gold standard; Gutt index; hepatic insulin sensitivity index; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin clearance; insulin sensitivity; insulin treatment; male; Matsuda index; middle aged; monotherapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oral glucose insulin sensitivity; oral glucose tolerance test; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index; randomized controlled trial; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; validity; weight reduction; analysis; blood; comparative study; evaluation study; gastric bypass surgery; glucose blood level; glucose clamp technique; glucose tolerance test; insulin resistance; Obesity, Morbid; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019996039"

We assessed the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide and the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor sitagliptin on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: In this 12 week, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, performed at the VU University Medical Center between July 2013 and August 2015, 52 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and/or sulphonylurea agent ([mean ± SD] age 62.7 ± 6.9 years, HbA1c 7.3 ± 0.7% or 56 ± 1 mmol/mol) were allocated to once daily liraglutide 1.8 mg (n = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 18) or matching placebos (n = 17) by computer generated numbers. Both participants and researchers were blinded to group assignment. Hepatic fat content was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Hepatic fibrosis was estimated using three validated formulae. Results: One patient dropped out in the sitagliptin group owing to dizziness, but no serious adverse events occurred. At week 12, no between-group differences in hepatic steatosis were found. Liraglutide reduced steatosis by 10% (20.9 ± 3.4% to 18.8 ± 3.3%), sitagliptin reduced steatosis by 12.1% (23.9 ± 3.0% to 21.0 ± 2.7%) and placebo lessened it by 9.5% (18.7 ± 2.7% to 16.9 ± 2.7%). Neither drug affected hepatic fibrosis scores compared with placebo. Conclusions/interpretation: Twelve-week liraglutide or sitagliptin treatment does not reduce hepatic steatosis or fibrosis in type 2 diabetes.

According to principles of chronic disease management, healthcare professionals should work collaboratively with patients to determine appropriate therapeutic strategies that address overweight and obesity, specifically considering a patient's disease status in addition to their individual needs, preferences, and attitudes regarding treatment. A central role and responsibility of healthcare professionals in this process is to inform and educate patients about their treatment options. Although current recommendations for the management of adult obesity provide general guidance regarding safe and proper implementation of lifestyle, pharmacological, and surgical interventions, healthcare professionals need awareness of specific evidence-based information that supports individualized clinical application of these therapies. More specifically, healthcare professionals should be up-to-date on approaches that promote successful lifestyle management and be knowledgeable about newer weight loss pharmacotherapies, so they can offer patients with obesity a wide range of options to personalize their treatment. Accordingly, this educational activity has been developed to provide participants with the latest information on treatment recommendations and therapeutic advances in lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy for adult obesity management. Design and Methods This supplement is based on the content presented at a live CME symposium held in conjunction with ObesityWeek 2014. Results This supplement provides an expert summary of current treatment recommendations and recent advances in nonsurgical therapies for the management of adult obesity. Patient and provider perspectives on obesity management are highlighted in embedded video clips available via QR codes, and new evidence will be applied using clinically relevant case studies. Conclusions This supplement provides a topical update of obesity management, including clinical practice examples, for healthcare professionals who treat or provide care for adults with obesity. © 2015 The Obesity Society.","","Adult; Attitude to Health; Chronic Disease; Congresses as Topic; Female; Humans; Life Style; Overweight; Patient Education as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Risk Reduction Behavior; United States; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; amfepramone; amitriptyline; benzphetamine; cyproheptadine; fluoxetine; haloperidol; insulin; leuprorelin; liraglutide; lithium; lorcaserin; mirtazapine; nortriptyline; olanzapine; phendimetrazine; phenelzine; phentermine; phentermine plus topiramate; placebo; propranolol; quetiapine; sertraline; tetrahydrolipstatin; thioridazine; topiramate; tranylcypromine; triacylglycerol lipase; unindexed drug; valproic acid; abdominal pain; adult; Article; backache; bariatric surgery; behavior modification; body mass; caloric restriction; clinical practice; clinical trial (topic); conservative treatment; constipation; continuing education; controlled clinical trial (topic); cooperation; coughing; decreased appetite; defecation urgency; depression; diarrhea; dizziness; drug contraindication; drug dose comparison; drug dose escalation; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; dyspepsia; evidence based medicine; fatigue; feces incontinence; flatulence; headache; health care availability; health care need; health hazard; human; hypoglycemia; individualization; insomnia; lifestyle modification; medical expert; nausea; needs assessment; obesity; paresthesia; patient attitude; patient care; patient decision making; patient education; patient safety; personalized medicine; physical activity; physician attitude; practice guideline; randomized controlled trial (topic); recommended drug dose; risk benefit analysis; Roux Y anastomosis; self monitoring; side effect; sleeve gastrectomy; steatorrhea; stomach bypass; symposium; taste disorder; treatment planning; videorecording; vomiting; weight gain; weight reduction; xerostomia; attitude to health; chronic disease; female; lifestyle; organization; Overweight; risk reduction; standards; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936761068"

However, achieving and maintaining weight loss by diet and physical activity remains challenging, and may often require pharmacotherapy. Liraglutide 3.0 mg has recently been approved for weight management in the United States, Canada, and EU. The current analysis used a summative usability test to assess safety and effectiveness, ease of use, and training requirements for the novel liraglutide 3.0 mg pen injector. Methods: Of the 234 participants, half received instructions for use and video-based training and/or opportunity to handle the device. All participants (excluding pharmacists) performed 6 tasks followed by post- task interviews on task difficulty, device ease of use, and any use errors, close calls, and operational difficulties. Tasks included differentiation of correct box and pen injector, medication clarity assessment, normal, dose reversal, and end-of-content injection. Number/type of use errors, close calls, and operational difficulties were evaluated. Results: All assessed participants interpreted the instructions for use correctly. No potentially serious use errors, and low numbers of nonserious errors, were reported. Overall, participants committed 105 use errors related to handling, with no potential for harm. A total of 25 close calls and 44 operational difficulties were reported without any pattern indicative of a design flaw. Marked differences in the incidence of events were observed for trained versus untrained participants regardless of prior injection experience. Participants rated ease of use as 6.4/7. Conclusions: The liraglutide 3.0 mg pen injector is safe and easy to use for liraglutide administration.

Liraglutide, an analog of glucagon-like peptide-1, is indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Liraglutide has recently been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Nevertheless, whether liraglutide could reduce EAT is unknown. Methods: To test the hypothesis, a 6-month randomized, open-label, controlled study was performed in 95 type 2 diabetic subjects with body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2 and hemoglobinA1c ≤8% on metformin monotherapy. Individuals were randomized in two groups to receive additional liraglutide up to 1.8 mg s.c. once daily (n = 54) or to remain on metformin up to 1,000 mg twice daily (n = 41). Ultrasound-measured EAT thickness was measured at baseline and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Results: In the liraglutide group, EAT decreased from 9.6 ± 2 to 6.8 ± 1.5 and 6.2 ± 1.5 mm (P < 0.001), accounting for a −29% and −36% of reduction at 3 and 6 months, respectively, whereas there was no EAT reduction in the metformin group; BMI and hemoglobinA1c improved only in the liraglutide group after 6 months. Conclusions: Liraglutide causes a substantial and rapid EAT reduction.

Truncal obesity plays an exceptionally critical role among all metabolic traits of the MetS. Consequently, the prevalence of the MetS has steadily increased with the growing epidemic of obesity. Pharmacotherapy has been available for obesity for more than one decade, but with little success in improving the metabolic profiles. The serotonergic drugs and inhibitors of pancreatic lipases were among the few drugs that were initially approved to treat obesity. At the present time, only the pancreatic lipase inhibitor orlistat is approved for long-term treatment of obesity. New classes of anti-diabetic drugs, including glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists and Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, are currently being evaluated for their effects on obesity and metabolic traits. The genetic studies of obesity and metabolic syndrome have identified novel molecules acting on the hunger and satiety peptidergic signaling of the gut-hypothalamus axis or the melanocortin system of the brain and are promising targets for future drug development. The goal is to develop drugs that not only treat obesity, but also favorably impact its associated traits. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: This was a prospective, open-label, single-center observational follow-up at the Cabinet Medical de Diabétologie, Lausanne, Switzerland, of 61 patients [HbA1c 9.2% (77 mmol/mol) and 56.1 U total insulin] initiated with IDegLira at 20 dose steps (20 U IDeg/0.72 mg Lira), except in insulin-naïve patients who began treatment at 16 dose steps. Thereafter, the dose was titrated by four dose steps once weekly, according to individualized fasting blood glucose targets. Information about glycemic control, total insulin dose, weight, and blood pressure, along with any adverse events, was collected from medical records and patient reports during clinic visits at baseline, 3 months, and end of follow-up. Results: Over 6 months of follow-up, mean HbA1c improved (decrease of 1.7%) to 7.5% with concomitant weight loss. Switching to IDegLira resulted in a lower (−14.6 U) total insulin dose compared with baseline for those patients previously on insulin. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia during treatment with IDegLira. There were small decreases in both mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure with IDegLira. Six patients discontinued treatment early because of adverse gastrointestinal events with IDegLira. Conclusion: Switching to IDegLira, mostly from regimens using insulin in conjunction with oral antidiabetic medications in a real-world population of patients with type 2 diabetes, resulted in improved glucose control with a lower insulin dose and weight loss. © 2017, The Author(s).","IDegLira; Incretin; Insulin; Observational study; Type 2 diabetes","glucose; insulin; insulin degludec plus liraglutide; metformin; sulfonylurea; Article; clinical trial; female; follow up; glycemic control; human; hypoglycemia; major clinical study; male; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; Swiss; vomiting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016990575"

While the majority of patients with isolated steatosis generally have a benign course, a diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) carries a significantly higher risk for progression of disease, cirrhosis, and death. Pharmacologic therapeutic interventions in NASH have largely proven to be ineffective or unappealing due to long-term side-effect profiles, and the majority of patients cannot achieve or sustain targeted weight loss goals, necessitating an urgent need for therapeutic trials and drug development. The complex molecular mechanisms leading to NASH and the long duration of time to develop complications of disease are challenges to developing meaningful clinical endpoints. Because of these challenges, surrogate endpoints that are linked to all-cause mortality, liver-related death, and complications of cirrhosis are much more likely to be beneficial in the majority of patients.","Cirrhosis; Endpoints; Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; Surrogate marker","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; betaine; exendin 4; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; liraglutide; metformin; pentoxifylline; tetrahydrolipstatin; ursodeoxycholic acid; Article; Child Pugh score; clinical trial (topic); congestive heart failure; fracture; heart muscle ischemia; hepatic venous pressure gradient; human; hyperlipidemia; insulin resistance; liver biopsy; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver fibrosis; liver stiffness; magnetic resonance elastography; Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score; mortality; nonalcoholic fatty liver; Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score; obesity; osteopenia; portal hypertension; pressure gradient; quality of life; side effect; transient elastography; venous pressure; weight reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006987174"

The past 3 years have seen approval of a number of novel antiobesity drugs. The majority of these influence hypothalamic appetite pathways via dopaminergic or serotoninergic signalling. Some are combination therapies, allowing lower doses to minimize the potential for off-target effects. An alternative approach is to mimic endogenous satiety signals using long-lasting forms of peripheral appetitesuppressing hormones. There is also considerable interest in targeting thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue to increase resting energy expenditure. Obesity pharmacotherapy has seen several false dawns, but improved understanding of the pathways regulating energy balance, and better-designed trials, give many greater confidence that recently approved agents will be both efficacious and safe. Nevertheless, a number of issues from preclinical and clinical development continue to attract debate, and additional large-scale trials are still required to address areas of uncertainty. © The Author(s) 2015.","","Anti-Obesity Agents; Energy Metabolism; Forecasting; Humans; Obesity; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; antiobesity agent; liraglutide; lorcaserin; phentermine plus topiramate; tetrahydrolipstatin; antiobesity agent; antiobesity therapy; Article; bariatric surgery; brown adipose tissue; caloric intake; drug therapy; energy balance; energy expenditure; human; obesity; resting energy expenditure; thermogenesis; weight loss program; weight reduction; drug effects; energy metabolism; forecasting; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930928930"

Methods: A search of the English language literature was performed using PubMed search terms: “liraglutide”, “glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist”, and “randomized clinical trial”. Articles and bibliographies relevant to the subject were reviewed and additional references known to the authors were included. Results: Five randomized, placebo-controlled trials of liraglutide for weight management were identified. In addition to recommended diet and physical activity, liraglutide consistently resulted in a 4 to 6 kg weight loss, with a greater proportion of patients achieving at least 5 and 10% weight loss compared with placebo. The most common adverse effects were gastrointestinal and primarily occurred early in the treatment course. Comparative data suggest that weight loss with liraglutide is greater than that seen with orlistat or lorcaserin, but slightly less that seen with phentermine/topiramate. Liraglutide 1.8 mg was recently shown to have cardiovascular benefit in a large outcomes trial; applicability of these results for the 3.0 mg formulation in a more diverse weight loss population at high cardiovascular risk is not currently known. Barriers to real-world clinical use as a first-line agent include gastrointestinal side effects, high cost, and need for injection. Conclusions: Liraglutide helps to induce and sustain weight loss in patients with obesity. Its efficacy is comparable to other available agents but it offers the unique benefit of improved glycemic control. Additional studies are needed to determine its long term efficacy and safety profile. © 2016 The Authors.

Obesity treatment guidelines recommend the use of pharmacologic therapy in adults who have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher or in patients with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or higher who have at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus). Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that has been successfully used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes for several years. Weight loss has been well described as an additional benefit with liraglutide therapy, which prompted the manufacturer to evaluate and develop a higher dose formulation specifically for the treatment of obesity. Liraglutide 3 mg/day was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication in December 2014. We performed a search of the Medline database to identify relevant literature focused on liraglutide's role specifically in treating obesity. Five clinical trials with this primary end point were identified. Data demonstrated that liraglutide can successfully achieve weight-loss benchmarks of 5% or more and 10% or more loss from baseline. The most common adverse effects were gastrointestinal and mild to moderate in intensity. The cost of therapy is high, averaging over $1000/month for out-of-pocket expenses if insurance coverage is not available. Liraglutide is also available for delivery only by subcutaneous injection, which may represent a barrier for patients. Liraglutide 3 mg/day represents another pharmacologic option for the treatment of obesity. © 2015 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","GLP-1; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; obesity; Saxenda; weight loss","Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Weight; Comorbidity; Drug Approval; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Liraglutide; Obesity; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Weight Loss; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; placebo; tetrahydrolipstatin; triacylglycerol lipase; antiobesity agent; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; abdominal pain; Article; comorbidity; constipation; decreased appetite; diarrhea; dizziness; drug bioavailability; drug cost; drug dose escalation; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug self administration; drug withdrawal; dyslipidemia; dyspepsia; elimination half-life; exercise; fatigue; gallbladder disease; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; hepatobiliary disease; human; hypertension; hypoglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; infection; low calory diet; low fat diet; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreatitis; satiety; side effect; sleep disordered breathing; stomach emptying; thyroid cancer; upper abdominal pain; volume of distribution; vomiting; weight reduction; agonists; body weight; drug approval; drug effects; economics; food and drug administration; obesity; randomized controlled trial (topic); United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945137054"

OBJECTIVE To compare weight loss and adverse events among drug treatments for obesity using a systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE,Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Central from inception to March 23, 2016; clinical trial registries. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials conducted among overweight and obese adults treated with US Food and Drug Administration-approved long-term weight loss agents (orlistat, lorcaserin, naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, or liraglutide) for at least 1 year compared with another active agent or placebo. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators identified studies and independently abstracted data using a predefined protocol. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed and relative ranking of agents was assessed using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportions of patients with at least 5%weight loss and at least 10% weight loss, magnitude of decrease in weight, and discontinuation of therapy because of adverse events at 1 year. RESULTS Twenty-eight randomized clinical trials with 29018 patients (median age, 46 years; 74%women; median baseline body weight, 100.5 kg; median baseline body mass index, 36.1) were included. A median 23%of placebo participants had at least 5%weight loss vs 75%of participants taking phentermine-topiramate (odds ratio [OR], 9.22; 95%credible interval [CrI], 6.63-12.85; SUCRA, 0.95), 63%of participants taking liraglutide (OR, 5.54; 95%CrI, 4.16-7.78; SUCRA, 0.83), 55%taking naltrexone-bupropion (OR, 3.96; 95%CrI, 3.03-5.11; SUCRA, 0.60), 49%taking lorcaserin (OR, 3.10; 95%CrI, 2.38-4.05; SUCRA, 0.39), and 44%taking orlistat (OR, 2.70; 95%CrI, 2.34-3.09; SUCRA, 0.22). All active agents were associated with significant excess weight loss compared with placebo at 1 year-phentermine-topiramate, 8.8 kg (95%CrI,-10.20 to-7.42 kg); liraglutide, 5.3 kg (95%CrI,-6.06 to-4.52 kg); naltrexone-bupropion, 5.0 kg (95%CrI,-5.94 to-3.96 kg); lorcaserin, 3.2 kg (95%CrI,-3.97 to-2.46 kg); and orlistat, 2.6 kg (95%CrI,-3.04 to-2.16 kg). Compared with placebo, liraglutide (OR, 2.95; 95%CrI, 2.11-4.23) and naltrexone-bupropion (OR, 2.64; 95%CrI, 2.10-3.35) were associated with the highest odds of adverse event-related treatment discontinuation. High attrition rates (30%-45%in all trials) were associated with lower confidence in estimates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among overweight or obese adults, orlistat, lorcaserin, naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, and liraglutide, compared with placebo, were each associated with achieving at least 5%weight loss at 52 weeks. Phentermine-topiramate and liraglutide were associated with the highest odds of achieving at least 5%weight loss. © 2016 American Medical Association.

Diabetes and obesity are intrinsically linked: obesity increases the risk of diabetes and also contributes to disease progression and cardiovascular disease. Although the benefits of weight loss in the prevention of diabetes and as a critical component of managing the condition are well established, weight reduction remains challenging for individuals with type 2 diabetes due to a host of metabolic and psychological factors. For many patients, lifestyle intervention is not enough to achieve weight loss, and alternative options, such as pharmacotherapy, need to be considered. However, many traditional glucose-loweringmedications may lead to weight gain. This article focuses on the potential of currently available pharmacological strategies and on emerging approaches in development to support the glycemic and weight-loss goals of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Two pharmacotherapy types are considered: Those developed primarily for blood glucose control that have a favorable effect on body weight and those developed primarily to induce weight loss that have a favorable effect on blood glucose control. Finally, the potential of combination therapies for the management of obese patients with type 2 diabetes is discussed. ©2015 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Anti-Obesity Agents; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; Drug Therapy, Combination; Forecasting; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Obesity; Risk Reduction Behavior; Weight Gain; Weight Loss; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; amylin derivative; beloranib; biguanide derivative; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; empagliflozin; exendin 4; glitazone derivative; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucose; incretin; insulin; insulin degludec plus liraglutide; insulin glargine; ipragliflozin; liraglutide; lixisenatide; lorcaserin; metformin; phentermine plus topiramate; placebo; pramlintide; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea derivative; tetrahydrolipstatin; tofogliflozin; unindexed drug; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; glucose blood level; Article; body weight management; constipation; depression; diabetic obesity; diarrhea; disease association; drug approval; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug safety; drug tolerability; gastrointestinal symptom; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; lifestyle modification; meta analysis (topic); mycosis; nausea; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; paresthesia; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); randomized controlled trial (topic); rhinopharyngitis; risk benefit analysis; side effect; suicidal ideation; sustained drug release; treatment duration; urinary tract infection; valvular heart disease; vomiting; weight gain; weight reduction; xerostomia; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; drug combination; drug effects; forecasting; metabolism; obesity; risk reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940559645"

We investigated whether weight changes in the SCALE program with liraglutide 3.0 mg were associated with changes in serum creatinine. Methods Post hoc analysis of two 56-week, randomized, double-blind trials: SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes (n = 3731, without type 2 diabetes [T2D], randomized [2:1] to liraglutide 3.0 mg [n = 2487] or placebo [n = 1244]); SCALE Diabetes (n = 846 with T2D, randomized [2:1:1] to liraglutide 3.0 mg [n = 423], 1.8 mg [n = 211, excluded from this analysis] or placebo [n = 212]). NCT01272219/NCT01272232. Results In SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes, mean (± SD) weight loss (baseline to week 56) with liraglutide was 8.0 ± 6.7% (2.6 ± 6.9% with placebo); baseline creatinine with liraglutide was 76 ± 15 μmol/L and 74 ± 15 μmol/L after 56 weeks (similar across treatment groups).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We randomized 72 patients (placebo = 18, liraglutide = 54) with T1D to receive placebo and 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg liraglutide daily for 12 weeks. RESULTS In the 1.2-mg and 1.8-mg groups, the mean weekly reduction in average blood glucose was -0.55 ± 0.11 mmol/L (10 ± 2 mg/dL) and -0.55 ± 0.05 mmol/L (10± 1 mg/dL), respectively (P < 0.0001), while it remained unchanged in the 0.6-mg and placebo groups. In the 1.2-mg group, HbA1c fell significantly (-0.78 ± 15%, -8.5 ± 1.6 mmol/mol, P < 0.01), while it did not in the 1.8-mg group (-0.42 ± 0.15%, 24.± 1.6 mmol/mol, P = 0.39) and 0.6-mg group (-0.26 ±0.17%, -2.8 ± 1.9 mmol/mol, P = 0.81) vs. the placebo group (-0.3 ± 0.15%, -3.3 ± 1.6 mmol/mol). Glycemic variability was reduced by 5 ± 1% (P < 0.01) in the 1.2-mg group only. Total daily insulin dose fell significantly only in the 1.2-mg and 1.8-mg groups (P < 0.05). There was a 5 ± 1 kg weight loss in the two higher-dose groups (P < 0.05) and by 2.7 ± 0.6 kg (P < 0.01) in the 0.6-mg group vs. none in the placebo group. In the 1.2- and 1.8-mg groups, postprandial plasma glucagon concentration fell by 72 ± 12% and 47 ± 12%, respectively (P < 0.05). Liraglutide led to higher gastrointestinal adverse events (P < 0.05) and ≤1% increases (not significant) in percent time spent in hypoglycemia (<55 mg/dL, 3.05 mmol/L). CONCLUSIONS Addition of 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg liraglutide to insulin over a 12-week period in overweight and obese patients with T1D results in modest reductions of weekly mean glucose levels with significantweight loss, small insulin dose reductions, and frequent gastrointestinal side effects. These findings do not justify the use of liraglutide in all patients with T1D. © 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adult; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Glucagon; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Postprandial Period; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; C peptide; C reactive protein; glucagon; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; placebo; antidiabetic agent; glucagon; glucose blood level; insulin; liraglutide; adult; Article; carbohydrate intake; controlled study; diarrhea; double blind procedure; drug dose comparison; drug dose escalation; drug dose reduction; drug dose titration; drug effect; drug withdrawal; female; gastrointestinal disease; glucagon blood level; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; loss of appetite; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nausea; obesity; patient compliance; phase 4 clinical trial; postprandial state; prospective study; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; systolic blood pressure; treatment duration; United States; vomiting; weight reduction; body weight; chemically induced; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; hypoglycemia; metabolism; time factor; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971249932"

Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide in glucose-tolerant patients with plaque psoriasis. Methods A total of 20 obese (body mass index > 25 kg/m2), glucose-tolerant patients with plaque psoriasis (psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) of at least 8) were randomized 1: 1 to once-daily subcutaneous injections with liraglutide or placebo for an 8-week period. The primary end points were improvement in PASI and dermatology life quality index (DLQI). Secondary end points included changes in weight and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, as well as adverse events. Results After 8 weeks of treatment, no significant change in PASI was found in the liraglutide group (mean±standard deviation: -2.6 ± 2.1) compared with the placebo group (-1.3 ± 2.4) (P = 0.228). No difference in DLQI was observed between the groups [-2.5 ± 4.4 (liraglutide) vs. -3.7 ± 4.8 (placebo); P = 0.564]. HsCRP did not change in any of the groups (0.26 ± 1 (placebo) vs. 0.25 ± 2.2 (liraglutide); P = 0.992). Liraglutide treatment resulted in a bodyweight loss of 4.7 ± 2.5 kg compared with 1.6 ± 2.7 kg in the placebo group (P = 0.014) accompanied by decreased cholesterol levels. No serious adverse events occurred during the 8-week observation period. The most common complaint was transient nausea, which occurred in 45% of the liraglutide-treated patients but in none from the placebo group. Conclusion Liraglutide treatment for 8 weeks did not significantly change PASI, DLQI, or hsCRP in a small group of glucose-tolerant obese patients with plaque psoriasis compared with placebo. A significant weight loss and decrease in cholesterol levels was observed in liraglutide-treated patients. © 2014 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.","","Adalimumab; Adult; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Psoriasis; Registries; adalimumab; C reactive protein; cholesterol; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; placebo; antiinflammatory agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; adult; Article; body mass; body weight; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; constipation; controlled study; Dermatology Life Quality Index; disease severity; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; glycemic control; hemoglobin blood level; human; loss of appetite; male; morning dosage; nausea; obesity; priority journal; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; psoriasis vulgaris; randomized controlled trial; treatment duration; weight reduction; agonists; glucose tolerance test; middle aged; prospective study; psoriasis; register","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923022280"

Design/main outcome measure: A 12-week prospective randomized open-label study was conducted with 45 obese women with PCOS diagnosed by the ASRM-ESHRE Rotterdam criteria. They were randomized to metformin (MET) 1000 mg BID or liraglutide (LIRA) 1.2 mg QD s.c. or roflumilast (ROF) 500 mcg QD. The primary outcome was change in measures of obesity. Results: Forty-one patients (aged 30.7∈±∈7.9 years, BMI 38.6∈±∈6.0 kg/m2, mean∈±∈SD) completed the study. Subjects treated with LIRA lost on average 3.1∈±∈3.5 kg (p∈=∈0.006), on ROF 2.1∈±∈2.0 kg (p∈=∈0.002) vs. 0.2∈±∈1.83 kg in MET group.

LIRA was superior to MET in reducing weight (p∈=∈0.022), BMI (p∈=∈0.020), waist circumference (p∈=∈0.007). LIRA also resulted in decrease in VAT area (p∈=∈0.015) and more favorable dynamics in glucose homeostasis during OGTT. ROF resulted in reduction of waist circumference (p∈=∈0.023). In addition, ROF led to testosterone reduction (p∈=∈0.05) and increase in menstrual frequencies (p∈=∈0.009) when compared to baseline. Conclusion: Short-term monotherapy with liraglutide or roflumilast was associated with significant weight loss in obese PCOS. Liraglutide was superior to metformin, whereas roflumilast resulted in greater, yet not statistically significant, mean weight loss when compared to metformin. Reduction of body weight with liraglutide resulted in improvement of body composition.

Methods: The design of the study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in patients with stable CAD and newly diagnosed well-controlled T2DM. Patients were treated with liraglutide/metformin vs placebo/metformin for a 12 + 12-week period with ≥2-week wash-out. First phase insulin secretion (AIRg), Si and Sg were estimated by the Bergman Minimal Model, enabling calculation of beta-cell function; Disposition Index (DI) = AIRg × Si. A total of 30 patients from among 41 randomized were available for paired analysis. Results: Baseline characteristics were: HbA1c 47 mmol/mol (SD 6), BMI 31.6 kg/m2 (SD 4.8), fasting plasma-glucose 6.9 mmol/L (IQR 6.1; 7.4) and HOMA-IR 4.9 (IQR 3.0; 7.5). Liraglutide treatment improved AIRg by 3-fold, 497 mU × L−1 × min (IQR 342; 626, P <.0001) and DI by 1-fold, 766 (SD 824, P <.0001). Despite a significant weight loss of −2.7 kg (−6.7; −0.6) during liraglutide treatment, we found no improvement in HOMA-IR, Si or Sg. Weight loss during liraglutide therapy did not result in a carry-over effect. Conclusion: Liraglutide as add-on to metformin induces a clinically significant improvement in beta-cell function in overweight/obese, high cardiovascular risk patients with newly diagnosed well-controlled T2DM and CAD. The effect of liraglutide on DI is mediated entirely by improved AIRg whereas the effects on Si and Sg are neutral. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","beta-cell function; glucose effectiveness; insulin sensitivity; liraglutide; type 2 diabetes","Aged; Blood Glucose; Coronary Artery Disease; Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Liraglutide; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Obesity; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; metformin; add on therapy; adult; Article; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery disease; crossover procedure; diet restriction; double blind procedure; drug dose titration; female; glucose blood level; glucose effectiveness; glucose metabolism; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; male; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas islet beta cell; patient compliance; randomized controlled trial; weight reduction; aged; blood; complication; coronary artery disease; drug effects; insulin resistance; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; physiology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013684704"

This study was conducted as an exploratory analysis to clarify the effects of liraglutide, a GLP-1RA, on beta cell function, fat distribution and pancreas volume compared with metformin in Japanese overweight/obese patients with T2DM. Methods: A subpopulation of the Keio study for Initial treatment of type 2 Diabetes with Liraglutide versus Metformin (KIND-LM) study participants (n = 20, 10 in oral metformin group and 10 in subcutaneous liraglutide group) who were enrolled at Keio University Hospital and underwent frequently sampled mixed meal tolerance test (MTT) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) at weeks 0 and 24 were included in this analysis. The patients were treated with either metformin or liraglutide throughout the 24-week study period. Results: Changes in glycemic parameters such as glycated hemoglobulin (HbA1c), glycated albumin and 1,5-anhydroglucitol at week 24 were comparable between the groups. An oral minimal model based on MTT revealed that static-phase beta cell responsiveness (Φs) and static-phase disposition index were significantly increased at week 24 in the liraglutide group but not in the metformin group. There was no significant change in fat distribution as well as body weight at week 24 in either group. Serum amylase and lipase levels modestly but significantly increased in the liraglutide group during the study; however, there was no incidence of pancreatitis and pancreas volume was not changed in the liraglutide group. Conclusion: Liraglutide monotherapy for 24 weeks improved beta cell responsiveness with no change in either body weight or fat distribution. Further investigation is needed to clarify the mechanism by which liraglutide increases serum pancreatic enzymes.

There are a number of new drug therapies purportedly targeting appetite; liraglutide, and bupropion/naltrexone, which are European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate, which have FDA approval only. Each of the six drugs, used singly or in combination, has distinct pharmacological, and presumably distinct behavioural, mechanisms of action, thus the potential to provide defined therapeutic options to personalise the management of obesity. Yet, with regard to pharmacotherapy for obesity, we are far from true personalised medicine. We review the limited mechanistic data with four mono and combination pharmacotherapies, to assess the potential for tailoring their use to target specific obesogenic behaviours. Potential treatment options are considered, but in the absence of adequate research in respect to effects of these drugs on eating behaviour, neural activity and psychological substrates that underlie poorly controlled eating, we are far from definitive therapeutic recommendations. Specific mechanistic studies and broader behavioural phenotyping, possibly in conjunction with pharmacogenetic research, are required to characterise responders for distinct pharmacotherapeutic options. © 2017, The Author(s).","Appetite; Eating behaviour; Inhibitory control; Obesity; Personalised Medicine; Pharmacotherapy; Reward","Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Obesity; Precision Medicine; amfebutamone; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; lorcaserin; naltrexone; phentermine plus topiramate; placebo; antiobesity agent; appetite; Article; brain function; caloric intake; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial (topic); drug effect; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; energy expenditure; feeding behavior; food intake; human; mental disease; meta analysis (topic); monotherapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; personalized medicine; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); phenotype; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); reward; satiety; weight reduction; animal; drug effects; feeding behavior; obesity; personalized medicine; psychology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017662160"

In the 3-year assessment of the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial we aimed to evaluate the proportion of individuals with prediabetes who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults with prediabetes and a body-mass index of at least 30 kg/m2, or at least 27 kg/m2 with comorbidities, were randomised 2:1, using a telephone or web-based system, to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3·0 mg or matched placebo, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Time to diabetes onset by 160 weeks was the primary outcome, evaluated in all randomised treated individuals with at least one post-baseline assessment. The trial was conducted at 191 clinical research sites in 27 countries and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01272219. Findings The study ran between June 1, 2011, and March 2, 2015. We randomly assigned 2254 patients to receive liraglutide (n=1505) or placebo (n=749). 1128 (50%) participants completed the study up to week 160, after withdrawal of 714 (47%) participants in the liraglutide group and 412 (55%) participants in the placebo group. By week 160, 26 (2%) of 1472 individuals in the liraglutide group versus 46 (6%) of 738 in the placebo group were diagnosed with diabetes while on treatment. The mean time from randomisation to diagnosis was 99 (SD 47) weeks for the 26 individuals in the liraglutide group versus 87 (47) weeks for the 46 individuals in the placebo group. Taking the different diagnosis frequencies between the treatment groups into account, the time to onset of diabetes over 160 weeks among all randomised individuals was 2·7 times longer with liraglutide than with placebo (95% CI 1·9 to 3·9, p<0·0001), corresponding with a hazard ratio of 0·21 (95% CI 0·13–0·34). Liraglutide induced greater weight loss than placebo at week 160 (–6·1 [SD 7·3] vs −1·9% [6·3]; estimated treatment difference −4·3%, 95% CI −4·9 to −3·7, p<0·0001). Serious adverse events were reported by 227 (15%) of 1501 randomised treated individuals in the liraglutide group versus 96 (13%) of 747 individuals in the placebo group. Interpretation In this trial, we provide results for 3 years of treatment, with the limitation that withdrawn individuals were not followed up after discontinuation. Liraglutide 3·0 mg might provide health benefits in terms of reduced risk of diabetes in individuals with obesity and prediabetes.

GLP-1 treatment may however also directly influence AT that expresses the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). The present study aimed to assess the impact of GLP-1 analogue treatment on subcutaneous AT (SCAT) inflammatory and fibrotic responses, compared with weight loss by calorie reduction (control). Among the 39 participants with Type 2 diabetes recruited, 30 age-matched participants were randomized to 4 months treatment with Liraglutide (n=22) or calorie restriction based on dietetic counselling (n=8). Assessments included clinical characteristics and repeated subcutaneous abdominal AT biopsies. Liraglutide resulted in weight loss in most participants (-3.12± 1.72 kg, P=0.007) and significant reduction in visceral AT (VAT). It was more effective in lowering fasting glucose, in comparison with weight loss by dieting. However, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFA) AT-expression (P=0.0005), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression (P=0.027) and its serum levels (P=0.048) increased with Liraglutide, suggestive of an inflammatory response unlike in the diet arm in which a trend of lower cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) expression (P=0.09) was found. Liraglutide treatment also increased expression of factors involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, transforming growth factor-β (TGFB) and collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) (TGFB1: before 0.73± 0.09 arbitrary units (AU), after 1.00± 0.13 AU, P=0.006; COL1A1: 0.84± 0.09 AU compared with 1.49± 0.26 AU, P=0.026). Liraglutide thus appears to induce an inflammatory response in AT and influences ECM remodelling. Despite its superior effect on glycaemia, Liraglutide does not improve obesity-associated AT dysfunction in subcutaneous tissue. It is yet unclear whether this limits AT storage capacity for lipids. This may be of importance in patients being re-exposed to positive energy balance such as post GLP-1 discontinuation. © 2017 The Author(s).","","Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Extracellular Matrix; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Inflammation; Leptin; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; CD14 antigen; collagen type 1; collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain; gliclazide; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; adiponectin; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; leptin; liraglutide; adipose tissue biopsy; adipose tissue dysfunction; adult; Article; biopsy; body mass; caloric restriction; clinical article; controlled study; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; extracellular matrix; fat mass; female; follow up; glucose blood level; human; insulin blood level; intraperitoneal fat; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutritional counseling; obesity; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; subcutaneous fat disorder; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; weight reduction; adipose tissue; aged; analogs and derivatives; complication; drug effects; inflammation; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015079698"

Key Messages: With rising demands on liver services, identifying those at risk of developing significant liver disease is important, so that risk factors for disease progression can be addressed. Emerging diagnostic techniques make it possible to diagnose significant fibrosis without the need for liver biopsy, and while there are currently no approved therapies for NAFLD, a specialist clinic can also provide access to clinical trials. For patients who develop cirrhosis, the presence of multiple comorbidities necessitates expertise in the selection and management of individuals requiring LT. Conclusions: A dedicated multidisciplinary NAFLD clinic facilitates rationalisation of services, improves patient outcomes, and provides access to emerging diagnostics and therapies. © 2017 S.

We investigated whether these effects could be mediated by the central nervous system (CNS). Research Design and Methods We performed a randomized crossover study in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 20, mean age 59.3 ± 4.1 years, mean BMI 32 ± 4.7 kg/m2), consisting of two periods of 12-week treatment with either liraglutide 1.8 mg or insulin glargine. Using functional MRI, we determined the effects of treatment on CNS responses to viewing food pictures in the fasted condition and 30 min after meal intake. Results After 12 weeks, the decrease in HbA1c was larger with liraglutide versus insulin glargine (δ-20.7% vs.-20.2%, P < 0.001). Body weight decreased during liraglutide versus insulin glargine (δ-23.3 kg vs. 0.8 kg, P < 0.001). After 10 days, patients treated with liraglutide, compared with insulin glargine, showed decreased responses to food pictures in insula and putamen (P ≤ 0.02). In addition, liraglutide enhanced the satiating effect of meal intake on responses in putamen and amygdala (P ≤ 0.05). Differences between liraglutide and insulin glargine were not observed after 12 weeks. Conclusions Compared with insulin, liraglutide decreased CNS activation significantly only after short-term treatment, suggesting that these effects of GLP-1RA on the CNS may contribute to the induction of weight loss, but not necessarily to its maintenance, in viewof the absence of an effect of liraglutide on CNS activation in response to food pictures after longer-term treatment. © 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Brain; Cross-Over Studies; Cues; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fasting; Female; Food; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin Glargine; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Satiation; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin glargine; liraglutide; metformin; sulfonylurea derivative; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose blood level; insulin; insulin glargine; liraglutide; adult; aged; Article; central nervous system; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; decreased appetite; diarrhea; diet restriction; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug response; evening dosage; female; food; food intake; functional magnetic resonance imaging; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypoglycemia; insula; long term care; male; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; putamen; randomized controlled trial; satiety; short course therapy; visual stimulation; vomiting; weight reduction; association; body weight; brain; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; middle aged; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962130451"

Higher doses are more effective than lower doses, although higher doses are also more poorly tolerated. Metformin may enhance the weight-lowering potential of LIRA via the stimulatory modulation of incretin in addition to its direct beneficial effects in PCOS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether metformin as an adjunct to low-dose LIRA affects body weight with increased efficacy compared with low-dose LIRA alone in obese patients with PCOS. In a 12-week study, 44 obese women with PCOS were randomly offered either combined treatment (COMBO) with 1,000 mg metformin twice a day and 1.2 mg LIRA once a day, or treatment with 1.2 mg LIRA alone. The primary outcome of treatment was an alteration in the levels of obesity. A total of 43 patients [aged 30.3±4.4 years; body mass index (BMI) 37.2±4.5 kg/m2; mean ± standard deviation] completed the study. The subjects treated with COMBO lost on average 6.2±2.4 kg compared with a 3.8±3.5 kg weight loss in the patients treated with LIRA alone (P=0.024). The BMI decreased by 2.2±0.8 kg/m2 in patients treated with COMBO and by 1.4±1.2 kg/m2 in patients treated with LIRA alone (P=0.024). A clinically significant ≥5% weight reduction was achieved in 59.1% of patients treated with COMBO and 42.9% of patients treated with LIRA alone. Reductions in glucose levels following oral glucose tolerance testing, as well as in androstenedione levels in the COMBO group were significantly greater compared with those in the LIRA group. The side effects were mild and transient in the two treatment groups. A combination of metformin and low-dose LIRA was more effective than low-dose LIRA alone in reducing body weight in obese patients with PCOS. © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

Metformin is weight neutral, yet it could enhance the therapeutic index of GLP-1 agonist. We compared weight-lowering potential of liraglutide 1.2mg in combination with metformin to liraglutide 3mg monotherapy in obese PCOS. Methods: Thirty obese women with PCOS (aged 33.1±6.1years, BMI 38.3±5.4kg/m2) were randomized to combination (COMBO) of metformin (MET) 1000mg BID and liraglutide 1.2mg QD (N=15) or liraglutide 3mg (LIRA3) QD alone (N=15) for 12weeks. The primary outcome was change in anthropometric measures of obesity. Results: Both treatments led to significant weight loss (3.6±2.5kg, p=0.002 in COMBO vs 6.3±3.7kg, p=0.001 in LIRA3). BMI and waist circumference reduction in LIRA3 was greater than in COMBO (2.2±1.3 vs 1.3±0.9kg/m2                             , p=0.05 and 4.2±3.4 vs 2.2±6.2cm, p=0.014, respectively). Both interventions resulted in a significant decrease of post-OGTT glucose levels. COMBO significantly reduced total testosterone and was associated with less nausea. Conclusions: Short-term interventions with COMBO and LIRA3 both led to significant improvement of measures of obesity in obese PCOS, LIRA3 being superior to COMBO. However, COMBO further improved androgen profile beyond weight reduction and was associated with better tolerability.

Because of concerns regarding the potential of centrally-acting anti-obesity medications to affect mental health, pooled neuropsychiatric safety data from all phase 2 and 3a randomized, double-blind trials with liraglutide 3.0 mg were evaluated post hoc. Methods: Data from the liraglutide weight-management programme were pooled. Across trials, individuals with a body mass index ≥30 or ≥27 kg/m2 with weight-related comorbidities were randomized to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3.0 mg (n = 3384) or placebo (n = 1941), both with a 500 kcal/d deficit diet, plus exercise. Adverse events related to neuropsychiatric safety were collected in all trials. Additionally, in the phase 3a trials, validated mental-health questionnaires were prospectively and systematically administered. Results: In the pooled analysis of 5325 randomized and exposed individuals, rates of depression (2.1 vs 2.1 events/100 person-years) and anxiety (1.9 vs 1.7 events/100 person-years) through adverse event reporting were similarly low in liraglutide and placebo groups. Nine (0.3%) individuals receiving liraglutide and 2 (0.1%) receiving placebo reported adverse events of suicidal ideation or behaviour. In phase 3a trials, mean baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 2.8 ± 3.0 vs 2.9 ± 3.1 for liraglutide vs placebo improved to 1.8 ± 2.7 vs 1.9 ± 2.7, respectively, at treatment end; 34/3291 individuals (1.0%) receiving liraglutide 3.0 mg vs 19/1843 (1.0%) receiving placebo reported suicidal ideation on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Conclusions: Results of this exploratory pooled analysis provide no cause for concern regarding the neuropsychiatric safety of treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg in patients similar to those included in the examined trials. Although there was a small numerical imbalance in suicidal ideation with liraglutide through adverse event reporting, no between-treatment imbalances in suicidal ideation/behaviour or depression were noted through prospective questionnaire assessments. © 2017 The Authors.

Methods 57 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean ± SD age 62.8 ± 6.9 years; BMI 31.8 ± 4.1 kg/m2; HbA1c 7.3 ± 0.6%) were included in an acute (exenatide- or placebo-infusion) and 12-week (liraglutide, sitagliptin or placebo) randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Systemic haemodynamics (oscillometric technique and finger photoplethysmography), vascular stiffness (tonometry), and sympathetic nervous system (SNS)-activity (heart rate variability) were determined in the fasting state and following a standardised mixed meal. Results In both studies, postprandial blood pressure (BP) decreased during placebo-intervention. Compared with placebo, acute exenatide-infusion increased postprandial diastolic BP (6.7 [95%-confidence interval 3.6–9.9] mmHg, p < 0.001) and vascular resistance (683.6 [438.5–928.8] dyn*s/cm5/1.73 m2, p < 0.001), while cardiac index decreased (0.6 [0.40.8] L/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.001). Systolic BP, augmentation index and SNS-activity were unaffected. Twelve-week liraglutide-treatment did not affect postprandial haemodynamics, while sitagliptin decreased diastolic BP (3.5 [0.0–6.9] mmHg; p = 0.050), vascular resistance (309.9 [66.6–553.1] dyn*s/cm5/1.73 m2; p = 0.013) and cardiac index (0.3 [0.0–0.6] L/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.040), compared with placebo. Neither liraglutide nor sitagliptin affected SNS-activity or augmentation index. All treatments significantly lowered postprandial glucose levels. Conclusions Acute exenatide-infusion prevented the meal-induced decline in diastolic BP, although prolonged liraglutide intervention did not affect postprandial haemodynamics. The meal-induced drop in BP was augmented during sitagliptin-treatment. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Exenatide; GLP-1 receptor agonist; Haemodynamics; Heart rate; Liraglutide; Sympathetic nervous system","Adult; Aged; Blood Pressure; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Double-Blind Method; Fasting; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Peptides; Placebos; Postprandial Period; Sitagliptin Phosphate; Vascular Resistance; Venoms; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium antagonist; exendin 4; gliclazide; glimepiride; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; sitagliptin; tolbutamide; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; peptide; sitagliptin; venom; adrenergic system; adult; age distribution; Article; blood pressure measurement; body mass; cardiovascular parameters; Caucasian; controlled study; dizziness; double blind procedure; drug tolerability; female; heart hemodynamics; heart rate variability; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; oscillometry; photoelectric plethysmography; pollakisuria; postmenopause; postprandial state; pulse wave; randomized controlled trial; sex difference; tonometry; vascular resistance; aged; blood; blood pressure; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; diet restriction; drug effects; heart rate; hemodynamics; metabolism; middle aged; Overweight; pathophysiology; physiology; postprandial state","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009061052"

In this study, we investigate whether modulation of CNS responses to palatable food consumption may be a mechanism by which GLP1 contributes to the central regulation of feeding. Using functional MRI, we determined the effects of endogenous GLP1 and treatment with the GLP1 analogue liraglutide on CNS activation to chocolate milk receipt. Study 1 included 20 healthy lean individuals and 20 obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Scans were performed on two occasions: during infusion of the GLP1 receptor antagonist exendin 9 - 39 (blocking actions of endogenous GLP1) and during placebo infusion. Study 2 was a randomised, cross-over intervention study carried out in 20 T2DM patients, comparing treatment with liraglutide to insulin, after 10 days and 12 weeks. Compared with lean individuals, T2DM patients showed reduced activation to chocolate milk in right insula (P = 0.04). In lean individuals, blockade of endogenous GLP1 effects inhibited activation in bilateral insula (P ≤ 0.03). Treatment in T2DM with liraglutide, vs insulin, increased activation to chocolate milk in right insula and caudate nucleus after 10 days (P ≤ 0.03); however, these effects ceased to be significant after 12 weeks. Our findings in healthy lean individuals indicate that endogenous GLP1 is involved in the central regulation of feeding by affecting central responsiveness to palatable food consumption. In obese T2DM, treatment with liraglutide may improve the observed deficit in responsiveness to palatable food, which may contribute to the induction of weight loss observed during treatment. However, no long-term effects of liraglutide were observed. © 2016 Society for Endocrinology.","fMRI; GLP1; Obesity; Palatable food; Type 2 diabetes","Appetite; Blood Glucose; Case-Control Studies; Central Nervous System; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Eating; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Liraglutide; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Peptide Fragments; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; placebo; exendin 9; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; peptide fragment; adult; aged; appetite; Article; blood sampling; cacao; caudate nucleus; central nervous system; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; diabetic patient; diarrhea; drug dose increase; feeding; female; food intake; functional magnetic resonance imaging; glucose blood level; human; hypoglycemia; insula; male; middle aged; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; short course therapy; taste; treatment duration; weight change; weight reduction; blood; case control study; central nervous system; complication; eating; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973534417"

Thus, during weight loss maintenance, GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) administration may inhibit weight loss-induced increases in soluble leptin receptors thereby preserving free leptin levels and preventing weight regain.Methods:In a randomized controlled trial, 52 healthy obese individuals were, after a diet-induced 12% body weight loss, randomized to treatment with or without administration of the GLP-1RA liraglutide (1.2 mg per day). In case of weight gain, low-calorie diet products were allowed to replace up to two meals per day to achieve equal weight maintenance. Glucose tolerance and hormone responses were investigated before and after weight loss and after 52 weeks weight maintenance. Primary end points: increase in soluble leptin receptor plasma levels and decrease in free leptin index after 52 weeks weight loss maintenance.Results:Soluble leptin receptor increase was 59% lower; 2.1±0.7 vs 5.1±0.8 ng ml-1 (-3.0 (95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.5 to-5.5)), P<0.001 and free leptin index decrease was 43% smaller;-62±15 vs-109±20 (-47 (95% CI=-11 to-83)), P<0.05 with administration of GLP-1RA compared with control group. The 12% weight loss was successfully maintained in both the groups with no significant change in weight after 52 weeks follow-up. The GLP-1RA group had greater weight loss during the weight maintenance period (-2.3 kg (95% CI=-0.6 to-4.0)), and had fewer meal replacements per day compared with the control group (minus one meal per day (95% CI=-0.6 to-1)), P<0.001. Fasting glucose was decreased by an additional-0.2±0.1 mmol l-1 in the GLP-1RA group in contrast to the control group, where glucose increased 0.3±0.1 mmol l-1 to the level before weight loss (-0.5mmol l-1 (95% CI=-0.1 to-0.9)), P<0.005. Meal response of peptide PYY 3-36 was higher at week 52 in the GLP-1RA group compared with the control group, P<0.05.Conclusions:The weight maintaining effect of GLP-1RAs may be mediated by smaller decrease in free leptin and higher PYY 3-36 response. Low dose GLP-1RA therapy maintained 12% weight loss for 1 year and may prevent pre-diabetes in obesity. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","","Adult; Appetite; Body Mass Index; Caloric Restriction; Denmark; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Incretins; Leptin; Liraglutide; Male; Obesity; Prediabetic State; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; ghrelin; glucose; insulin; leptin; leptin receptor; liraglutide; peptide YY [3-36]; triacylglycerol; GLP1R protein, human; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; incretin; leptin; liraglutide; adult; Article; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; diet restriction; female; follow up; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; hormone response; human; insulin blood level; major clinical study; male; nausea; obesity; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; systolic blood pressure; weight change; weight gain; weight reduction; agonists; appetite; blood; body mass; caloric restriction; Denmark; diet therapy; drug effects; obesity; Prediabetic State; treatment outcome; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928926835"

We assessed the efficacy and safety of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide as an add-on therapy to insulin for overweight adult patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at Steno Diabetes Center (Gentofte, Denmark). Patients aged 18 years or older with type 1 diabetes, insufficient glycaemic control (HbA1c >8% [64 mmol/mol]), and overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive insulin treatment plus either liraglutide or placebo (saline solution) by subcutaneous injection once per day. Randomisation was done in blocks of four. Treatment assignment was masked to investigators and patients. Treatment lasted 24 weeks and liraglutide was started at a dose of 0·6 mg per day, escalated to 1·2 mg per day after 1 week, and then again to 1·8 mg per day after another week. Intervals between dose increments could be extended at the discretion of the investigator. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints were changes in hypoglycaemic events, glycaemic variability, glycaemic excursions, insulin dose, bodyweight, postprandial plasma concentrations of glucagon and GLP-1, gastric emptying, blood pressure, heart rate, patient-reported outcome measures, time spent in hypoglycaemia, near-normoglycaemia, and hyperglycaemia, plasma fasting glucose, mean glucose, and cholesterol. Efficacy analyses were calculated by use of a mixed model, whereby a patient's data are used as long as the patient is in the study. The safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of their randomly assigned study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01612468. Findings: Between July 10, 2012, and May 30, 2014, we enrolled 100 patients with type 1 diabetes, with 50 patients allocated liraglutide and 50 to placebo. Four patients from the liraglutide group and six patients from the placebo group discontinued treatment before 24 weeks. At the end of treatment, change in HbA1c from baseline did not differ between groups (-0·5%, 95% CI -0·8 to -0·4 [-6·0 mmol/mol, 95% CI -8·7 to -4·4] with liraglutide vs -0·3%, -0·6 to -0·2 [-4·0 mmol/mol, -6·6 to -2·3] with placebo; between-group difference -0·2% [-0·5 to 0·1; 2·2 mmol/mol, -5·5 to 1·1], p=0·1833). The number of hypoglycaemic events was reduced with liraglutide, with an incident rate ratio of 0·82 (95% CI 0·74 to 0·90). However, we detected no changes in glycaemic variability (continuous overall net glycaemic action per 60 min from 10·3 [95% CI 9·8 to 10·8] to 9·9 [9·2 to 10·6] in the liraglutide treated patients vs 10·2 [9·7 to 10·7] to 9·7 [9·1 to 10·3] in the placebo treated patients). Both bolus insulin (difference -5·8 IU, 95% CI -10·7 to -0·8, p=0·0227) and bodyweight (difference -6·8 kg, 95% CI -12·2 to -1·4, p=0·0145) decreased with liraglutide treatment compared with placebo. Heart rate increased with liraglutide, with a difference between groups of 7·5 bpm (95% CI 2·8-12·2, p=0·0019). Postprandial plasma glucagon and GLP-1 concentrations did not differ between groups (difference between groups at end of treatment: -408 mmol/L per 240 min [95% CI -941 to 125, p=0·1309] for glucagon and -266 mmol/L per 240 min [-1034 to 501, p=0·4899] for GLP-1). Gastric emptying was delayed after 3 weeks of treatment with liraglutide (19·9 min, 95% CI 0·8 to 39·0, p=0·0412), but we detected no difference after 24 weeks of treatment (-1·5 min, -20·5 to 17·6, p=0·8793). Patient-reported outcome measures differed between groups only with respect to perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia, which was higher with placebo, with a difference between groups of -0·6 (95% CI -1·1 to -0·07, p=0·0257). Liraglutide was associated with more frequent nausea (29 [58%] patients with liraglutide vs five [10%] with placebo), dyspepsia (11 [22%] patients with liraglutide vs one [2%] with placebo), diarrhoea (ten [20%] patients with liraglutide vs one [2%] with placebo), decreased appetite (seven patients [14%] with liraglutide vs none with placebo), and vomiting (seven [14%] patients with liraglutide vs one [2%] with placebo). Interpretation: In patients with type 1 diabetes, overweight, and insufficient glycaemic control, the reduction in HbA1c did not differ between insulin plus placebo and insulin plus liraglutide treatment. Liraglutide was associated with reductions in hypoglycaemic events, bolus and total insulin dose, and bodyweight, and increased heart rate.

This paper provides an overview of the design and rationale for a trial investigating whether lorcaserin, when combined with behavioral weight loss maintenance sessions (WLM), will facilitate the maintenance of losses of ≥ 5% of initial weight. Methods In this two-phase trial, participants with obesity will enroll in a 14-week run-in diet program consisting of weekly group lifestyle modification sessions and a 1000–1200 kcal/d meal replacement diet. Participants who complete this weight induction phase and lose at least 5% of initial weight will then be randomized to 52 weeks of WLM plus lorcaserin or WLM plus placebo. We hypothesize that at 52 weeks post randomization, participants assigned to WLM plus lorcaserin will achieve significantly better maintenance of the prior 5% weight loss. Results We will recruit 182 adults with obesity to participate in the diet run-in, 136 of whom (75%) are expected to become eligible for the randomized controlled trial. Co-primary outcomes include the percentage of participants who maintain a loss of at least 5% of initial weight at week 52 and change in weight (kg) from randomization to week 52. Conclusions This two-phase design will allow us to determine the potential efficacy of chronic weight management using lorcaserin for maintaining initial losses of at least 5% body weight, induced by the use of a structured meal-replacement diet. This combined approach holds promise of achieving larger long-term weight losses.

Data Sources: A MEDLINE search (1970 to March 2015) was conducted for English-language articles using the terms glucagon-like peptide 1, liraglutide, and obesity. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Published articles pertinent to the efficacy and safety of liraglutide for short- and long-term obesity management among overweight or obese patients and special populations were reviewed and summarized. Data Synthesis: Based on randomized placebocontrolled and active-comparator studies, liraglutide can increase weight loss among overweight and obese patients in a dose-dependent manner with once-daily doses of 1.2 to 3.0 mg. It has been shown that a higher proportion of patients experienced 5% and 10% weight loss from baseline compared with placebo and orlistat. Data support the potential benefit of liraglutide among overweight and obese patients with prediabetes, as well as women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with an inadequate response to metformin. Larger and more robust studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of liraglutide among other agents for obesity in diverse populations. Conclusions: Liraglutide is an adjunct to lifestyle modifications to improve success rates among overweight or obese individuals without diabetes. It may have a potential role in special populations, such as in those with prediabetes and women with PCOS. Based on its clinical evidence, liraglutide can result in more weight loss from baseline compared with orlistat and placebo. Adverse events associated with liraglutide are primarily gastrointestinal and usually dose dependent. © 2015, Annals of Pharmacotherapy, All rights Reserved.","Ambulatory care; Clinical pharmacy; Clinical practice guidelines; Endocrinology; Obesity","Anti-Obesity Agents; Female; Humans; Injections, Subcutaneous; Lactones; Life Style; Liraglutide; Obesity; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Prediabetic State; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; tetrahydrolipstatin; antiobesity agent; lactone; liraglutide; tetrahydrolipstatin; Article; body weight management; clinical effectiveness; controlled clinical trial (topic); human; impaired glucose tolerance; multicenter study (topic); obesity; ovary polycystic disease; patient safety; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment response; weight reduction; complication; female; impaired glucose tolerance; lifestyle; obesity; subcutaneous drug administration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943194818"

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of GLP-1 analogue liraglutide on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with MDI with inadequate glycaemic control. Methods Overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes and impaired glycaemic control treated with MDI were randomised to liraglutide or placebo over 24 weeks. Masked continuous glucose monitoring was performed at baseline and during the trial. The primary endpoint was the change in haemoglobin A1c from baseline to week 24. Additional endpoints include changes in weight, fasting glucose, glycaemic variability, treatment satisfaction, insulin dose, hypoglycaemias, blood pressure and blood lipid levels. Results Recruitment occurred between February 2013 and February 2014. A total of 124 patients were randomised. Study completion is anticipated in August 2014. Conclusions It is expected that the results of this study will establish whether adding liraglutide to patients with type 2 diabetes treated with MDI will improve glycaemic control, lower body weight, and influence glycaemic variability. © 2014 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

GSK2890457 (GSK457) is a combination of 4 nutritional agents, discovered by the systematic assessment of 16 potential components using the diet-induced obese mouse model, which was subsequently evaluated in a human study. Nonclinical Results: In the diet-induced obese mouse model, GSK457 (15% w/w in chow) given with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor agonist, exendin-4 AlbudAb, produced weight loss of 30.8% after 28 days of treatment. In db/db mice, a model of diabetes, GSK457 (10% w/w) combined with the exendin-4 AlbudAb reduced glucose by 217 mg/dL and HbA1c by 1.2% after 14 days. Clinical Results: GSK457 was evaluated in a 6 week randomized, placebo-controlled study that enrolled healthy subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes to investigate changes in weight and glucose. In healthy subjects, GSK457 well tolerated when titrated up to 40 g/day, and it reduced systemic exposure of metformin by ∼ 30%. In subjects with diabetes taking liraglutide 1.8 mg/day, GSK457 did not reduce weight, but it slightly decreased mean glucose by 0.356 mmol/L (95% CI: -1.409, 0.698) and HbAlc by 0.065% (95% CI: -0.495, 0.365), compared to placebo. In subjects with diabetes taking metformin, weight increased in the GSK457-treated group [adjusted mean % increase from baseline: 1.26% (95% CI: -0.24, 2.75)], and mean glucose and HbA1c were decreased slightly compared to placebo [adjusted mean glucose change from baseline: -1.22 mmol/L (95% CI: -2.45, 0.01); adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline: -0.219% (95% CI: -0.910, 0.472)]. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate remarkable effects of GSK457 in rodent models of obesity and diabetes, but a marked lack of translation to humans. Caution should be exercised with nutritional agents when predicting human efficacy from rodent models of obesity and diabetes. © 2016 Hodge et al.

Aim of the study was to evaluate a weight loss method on body composition, glycemic, lipid and hormone profiles, blood pressure and reactive oxygen species in people with treated type 2 diabetes. Methods: A 24-week open, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial including 272 adult patients with treated type 2 diabetes was performed. The patients were divided in two groups: Main group consisted of 208 patients who followed a method including a calorie restriction diet and optimal physical activity; Control included 64 patients who received conventional drug treatment with weight loss. Main Outcome Measures were weight loss, fasting glucose and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c. Secondary endpoints were blood pressure, lipid and insulin blood levels. Results: At 24 weeks, patients in Main weight lost between 8-18 kg (10-21%); their body mass index significantly decreased (-4.2 kg/m2) as well as their waist circumference (-13 cm) compared to Control. In Main weight loss was achieved fatty mass reduction. In Main fasting glucose and OGTT, HbA1c, blood pressure, reactive oxygen species decreased significantly, whereas hemoglobin levels and heel bone mineral density increased. In Main blood insulin levels decreased by 72.0%, cortisol levels decreased by 40.7%, while testosterone levels in men increased by 2.4 times from baseline. The application of the weight loss method led to a decrease in drug doses leading to their complete withdrawal. Conclusions: The results of this study show the beneficial role of a weight loss method in improving glycemic, lipid and hormone profiles, electrolyte and biochemical indices, blood pressure, reactive oxygen species and bone mineral density in patients with treated type 2 diabetes.

Methods We have described the practice patterns of 13 nephrologists in 4 centers, in a cohort of 301 consecutive adult type 2 diabetic patients. Among oral anti-diabetic prescriptions, we have detailed drugs dosage for each subject, with 3 different formulae for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and its adequation according to the latest ERBP recommendations (2015). As individuals were mostly obese in this work, we also compare adequacy rates using both standard indexed CKD-EPI formula and CKD-EPI formula de-indexed from body surface area. Results Using the CKD-EPI formula as the reference method for estimating GFR, 53.5% of patients were outside the recommendations, mostly for metformin (30% of the whole cohort) and for sitagliptin (17.9% of the whole cohort). With Cockcroft and Gault formula, 38.2% of persons were outside recommendations and 45.9% (p < 0.001) with CKD-EPI de-indexed. Among individuals consulting a nephrologist for the first time (n = 90), 61.1% were outside recommendations (p = 0.1). Among those persons under diabetologist supervision (n = 103), 63.1% were outside recommendations (p = 0.09), and were taking significantly more often metformin and insulin. Conclusion We have found a substantial number of inadequate OAD prescriptions in type 2 diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. The proportion of individuals outside guidelines was strongly affected by the method used for estimating GFR and by the type of practice, i.e., specialists versus general practitioners. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of long- acting GLP-1 RA liraglutide on eating behavior of women with PCOS have not been investigated yet. Methods: Thirty-six obese women with PCOS (mean±SD, aged 31.2±7.8 years, with BMI 38.7±0.1kg/m2), pretreated with metformin (1000mg BID) were switched to liraglutide 1.2mg QD sc for 12 weeks. Adiposity parameters and eating behavior as assessed by Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18) were examined at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results: Subjects treated with liraglutide lost on average 3.8±0.1kg (p<0.001). Significant reductions of waist circumference and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass, volume and area were demonstrated from liraglutide induction to the end of the study. TFEQ-R18 scores were significantly different pre- and post-liraglutide intervention. After treatment with liraglutide the uncontrolled eating (UE) score decreased from 36.8±24.5 to 19.6±18.4 (p<0.001) and emotional eating (EE) score decreased from 49.9±33.3 to 28.5±26.9 (p<0.001).

This guideline was funded by the Endocrine Society. Objective: To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of pediatric obesity. Participants: The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of 6 experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. Evidence: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned 2 systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies. Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society committees and members and co-sponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline. Conclusion: Pediatric obesity remains an ongoing serious international health concern affecting ;17%of US children and adolescents, threatening their adult health and longevity. Pediatric obesity has its basis in genetic susceptibilities influenced by a permissive environment starting in utero and extending through childhood and adolescence. Endocrine etiologies for obesity are rare and usually are accompanied by attenuated growth patterns. Pediatric comorbidities are common and long-term health complications often result; screening for comorbidities of obesity should be applied in a hierarchal, logical manner for early identification before more serious complications result. Genetic screening for rare syndromes is indicated only in the presence of specific historical or physical features. The psychological toll of pediatric obesity on the individual and family necessitates screening for mental health issues and counseling as indicated. The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. Although some behavioral and pharmacotherapy studies report modest success, additional research into accessible and effective methods for preventing and treating pediatric obesity is needed. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in themost seriously affected mature teenagerswho have failed lifestyle modification, but the use of surgery requires experienced teams with resources for long-term follow-up. Adolescents undergoing lifestyle therapy, medication regimens, or bariatric surgery for obesity will need cohesive planning to help them effectively transition to adult care, with continued necessary monitoring, support, and intervention. Transition programs for obesity are an uncharted area requiring further research for efficacy. Despite a significant increase in research on pediatric obesity since the initial publication of these guidelines 8 years ago, further study is needed of the genetic and biological factors that increase the risk of weight gain and influence the response to therapeutic interventions. Also needed are more studies to better understand the genetic and biological factors that cause an obese individual tomanifest one comorbidity vs another or to be free of comorbidities. Furthermore, continued investigation into the most effective methods of preventing and treating obesity and into methods for changing environmental and economic factors that will lead to worldwide cultural changes in diet and activity should be priorities. Particular attention to determining ways to effect systemic changes in food environments and total dailymobility, as well asmethods for sustaining healthy bodymass index changes, is of importance.

Design: Human studies using liraglutide 3.0 mg daily dose were selected through search based on PubMed listings and the Clinical trials.gov database using the term “liraglutide”. Results: During 56 weeks of treatment, liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment resulted in 5.9-8.0% weight reduction, while the placebo-subtracted weight loss was 3.9-6.0%. The proportion of treated patients with ≥ 5% weight loss was 50-76%, while the placebo-subtracted proportion was 29-46%. Liraglutide 3.0 mg treatment also induced a decrease in waist circumference, serum triglycerides, insulin resistance, blood pressure and an increase in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). The most common side effects were nausea, hypoglycemia, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting and headache. In the majority of patients liraglutide 3.0 mg was well tolerated.

Greater reductions in fasting plasma glucose (−3.4 ± 2.3 mM vs −0.3 ± 2.6 mM, P <.001) and systolic blood pressure (−5.4 ± 7.4 mm Hg vs −0.6 ± 11.1 mm Hg, P <.01) were seen with exercise plus liraglutide vs exercise plus placebo. The two groups experienced similar increases in quality of life during the intervention. Conclusions: In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, exercise combined with GLP-1RA treatment near-normalized HbA1c levels and caused a robust weight loss when compared with placebo. These results suggest that a combination of exercise and GLP-1RA treatment is effective in type 2 diabetes. © 2016 The Authors.

Methods: Samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were drawn at weeks 2, 12 and 28 of the phase IIIa SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes (N = 2339) and SCALE Diabetes (N = 584) trials. Dose proportionality of liraglutide in obese subjects was investigated using data from a phase II dose-finding study (N = 331). Results: Dose-proportional exposure of liraglutide up to and including 3.0 mg was confirmed. Body weight and sex influenced exposure of liraglutide 3.0 mg, while age ≥70 years, race, ethnicity and baseline glycaemic status did not. Compared with a reference subject weighing 100 kg, exposure of liraglutide 3.0 mg was 44 % lower for a subject weighing 234 kg (90 % CI 41–47), 41 % higher for a subject weighing 60 kg (90 % CI 37–46), and 32 % higher (90 % CI 28–35) in females than males with the same body weight. Neither injection site nor renal function significantly influenced exposure of liraglutide 3.0 mg (post hoc analysis). Conclusion: Population pharmacokinetics of liraglutide up to and including 3.0 mg daily in overweight and obese adults demonstrated dose-proportional exposure, and limited effect of covariates other than sex and body weight. These findings were similar to those previously observed with liraglutide up to 1.8 mg in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Agents that provide glycaemic control in addition to attenuating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are important for diabetes management. This review will focus on the off-target effects of incretin-based therapies on CVD risk factors [body weight, blood pressure (BP), lipid profile and albuminuria], major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), heart failure (HF) and beta-cell preservation. Methods A literature search was conducted to identify English-language publications for incretin-based therapies evaluating the following off-target end-points: body weight, BP, lipid profile, albuminuria, MACE, HF and beta-cell function. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were prioritised as the primary source of information. Results Overall, incretin-based therapies have shown beneficial effects on CVD risk factors, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists appear to have a more pronounced effect compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. RCTs are being conducted to determine if these positive effects on CVD risk factors translate to a reduction in MACE. To date, these studies have not shown an increase in MACE. A signal of increased hospitalisations for HF was observed with saxagliptin, warranting continued evaluation and vigilance in high-risk patients. In addition, incretin-based therapies have shown positive effects on measures of beta-cell function supporting their durability in the management of diabetes. Conclusions Incretin-based therapies are an important treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes, offering beneficial effects on CVD risk factors without increasing MACE. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; albiglutide; alogliptin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glibenclamide; glimepiride; glipizide; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; incretin; insulin; insulin detemir; insulin glargine; linagliptin; lipid; liraglutide; metformin; pioglitazone; placebo; rosiglitazone; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; vildagliptin; voglibose; antidiabetic agent; incretin; add on therapy; albuminuria; Article; blood pressure; body weight; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical practice; drug efficacy; heart failure; high risk patient; hormone inhibition; hospitalization; human; hypertension; hypoglycemia; lipid analysis; monotherapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); unspecified side effect; weight gain; weight reduction; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928558775"

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) increase HR, and studies have suggested that they may reduce HRV. We examined the effect of the GLP-1 RA liraglutide on HRV and diurnal variation of HR in overweight patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Liraglutide or placebo was administrated to a backbone therapy of metformin in this double-blind, placebo-controlled 12 + 12-week crossover study. SD of beatto-beat (NN) intervals (SDNN) was assessed by 24-h Holter monitoring as a measure of HRV. Diurnal HR variation and sympathovagal balance analyzed by root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) in NN intervals and highfrequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) power were assessed. RESULTS Compared with placebo, liraglutide decreased SDNN in 27 subjects (233.9ms; P < 0.001, paired analysis); decreased RMSSD (20.3 log-ms; P = 0.025); and increased themean HR (8.1 beats/min; P = 0.003), daytime HR (5.7; P = 0.083), and nighttime HR (6.3; P = 0.026). In a multivariable regression analysis, the decrease in SDNN remained significant after adjustment for metabolic and HR changes. Liraglutide reduced HF power (20.7 log-ms2; P = 0.026) without any change in LF/HF ratio. CONCLUSIONS In overweight patients with CAD and newly diagnosed T2D, liraglutide increased HR and reduced HRV despite significant weight loss and improvement in metabolic parameters. The increase in nightly HR in conjunction with a decrease in parameters of parasympathetic activity suggests that liraglutide may affect sympathovagal balance. © 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Aged; Circadian Rhythm; Coronary Artery Disease; Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Overweight; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; metformin; add on therapy; adult; Article; cardiovascular mortality; circadian rhythm; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery disease; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; drug dose increase; drug effect; female; heart rate; heart rate variability; Holter monitoring; human; male; metabolic parameters; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; parasympathetic tone; randomized controlled trial; weight reduction; aged; ambulatory electrocardiography; combination drug therapy; complication; coronary artery disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; middle aged; Overweight; pathophysiology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008221170"

Treatment-associated difficulties and side effects frequently cause deterioration in QOL. Liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, is a novel injection drug that promotes insulin secretion. It is a user-friendly, once-daily injection with fewer hypoglycemic events. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of liraglutide therapy on QOL in patients. Methods: In total, 304 insulin- and liraglutide-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this observational study; they received liraglutide therapy for 12 weeks. The main outcome measure was change in QOL from baseline, which was assessed using diabetes therapy-related QOL (DTR-QOL). Results: At week 12, liraglutide significantly decreased HbA1c levels (8.7 ± 1.5 vs. 7.5 ± 1.3, p < 0.001) and BMI (27.9 ± 5.3 vs. 27.3 ± 5.2, p < 0.001). According to the QOL scores, although the treatment modality had changed from non-injection to injection therapy, liraglutide improved patient satisfaction with treatment. Significant correlations were found between change in HbA1c level and satisfaction with treatment, as well as between change in body weight and burden on social and daily activities, anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment, and hypoglycemia. Conclusions: Liraglutide significantly improved glycemic control and reduced the body weight without deteriorating QOL in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.

The objective of this post hoc analysis was to quantify the relative contribution of weight loss to the treatment effects of liraglutide 3.0 mg on key efficacy endpoints. Methods: The analysis utilized data from 4725 participants across three randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01272219, NCT01272232 and NCT01557166). The duration of two of the trials was 56 weeks; one trial was of 32 weeks’ duration. A mediation analysis was performed, which ranked the relative contribution of weight loss to the treatment effects of liraglutide 3.0 mg on key cardiometabolic efficacy endpoints, Apnea–Hypopnea Index (AHI) and health-related quality of life (QoL). A limitation of this type of analysis is that it cannot conclusively prove a causal relationship. Results: In individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), endpoints predominantly driven by liraglutide-induced weight loss included waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, AHI, and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life–Lite total and physical function scores. Endpoints predominantly independent of weight loss included the glycemic endpoints hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose in individuals with and without T2DM. Regardless of the degree of dependence on weight loss according to the mediation analysis, greater weight loss was associated with greater improvement in all endpoints. Conclusion: Treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg contributes to improved cardiometabolic parameters, AHI and health-related QoL through both weight-loss dependent and weight-loss independent mechanisms. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Antiobesity medications; GLP-1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; obesity therapy; randomized clinical trial","Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Weight Loss; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; liraglutide; placebo; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; liraglutide; adult; apnea hypopnea index; Article; cardiometabolic risk; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; low calory diet; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physical activity; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; side effect; therapy effect; treatment duration; waist circumference; weight reduction; aged; blood pressure; body weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; randomized controlled trial (topic); weight reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994130135"

Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile acid-farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic acid), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI- 010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (Vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor á pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liverrelated morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy.

The current study series sought to more fully appraise its performance characteristics. Key questions addressed were comparison of the GGI to the hyperglycemic clamp (HGC), comparison of insulin secretory response patterns across three volunteer populations known to differ in β-cell function (healthy nonobese, obese nondiabetic, and type 2 diabetic), and characterization of effects of known insulin secretagogues in the context of a GGI. Insulin secretory response was measured as changes in insulin, C-peptide, insulin secretion rates (ISR), and ratio of ISR to prevailing glucose (ISR/G). The GGI correlated well with the HGC (r = 0.72 for ISR/G, P < 0.01). The insulin secretory response in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was significantly blunted (P < 0.001), whereas it was significantly increased in obese nondiabetics compared with healthy nonobese (P < 0.001). Finally, robust (P < 0.001 over placebo) pharmacological effects were observed in T2DM and healthy nonobese volunteers. Collectively, the findings of this investigational series bolster confidence that the GGI has solid attributes for assessing insulin secretory response to glucose across populations and pharmacology. Notably, the coupling of insulin secretory response to glycemic changes was distinctly and uniformly linear across populations and in the context of insulin secretagogues. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.","Diabetes; Exenatide; Graded glucose infusion; Hyperglycemic clamp; Liraglutide; Nonobese; Obese","Diabetes Mellitus; Double-Blind Method; Glucose; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Linear Models; Models, Biological; Nonlinear Dynamics; Obesity; Placebo Effect; Survival Rate; C peptide; exendin 4; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; glucose; insulin; Article; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; glucose blood level; glucose infusion; graded glucose infusion; human; hyperglycemia; hyperglycemic clamp technique; insulin blood level; insulin release; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; steady state; biological model; blood; diabetes mellitus; drug effects; glucose tolerance test; metabolism; nonlinear system; pancreas islet beta cell; placebo effect; procedures; secretion (process); statistical model; survival rate","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983652261"

Prof MacLean of Guy’s Hospital wrote in the Postgraduate Medical Journal in 1926 about the numerous challenges that faced patients and their healthcare professionals in delivering safe and effective diabetes care at that time. The discovery of insulin in 1922 heralded a new age in enabling longterm glycaemic control, which reduced morbidity and mortality. Thirty years later, the first oral agents for diabetes, the biguanides and sulfonylureas, appeared and freed type 2 patients from having to inject insulin following diagnosis. Improvements in insulin formulations over the decades, including rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogues that more closely mimic physiological insulin secretion, have increased the flexibility and efficacy of type 1 diabetes management. The last two decades have seen major advances in technology, which has manifested in more accurate glucose monitoring systems and insulin delivery devices (‘insulin pump’). Increased understanding of the pathophysiological deficits underlying type 2 diabetes has led to the development of targeted therapeutic approaches such as on the small intestine (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogues and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitors) and kidneys (sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors). A patient-centred approach delivered by a multidisciplinary team is now advocated. Glycaemic targets are set according to individual circumstances, taking into account factors such as weight, hypoglycaemia risk and patient preference. Stepwise treatment guidelines devised by international diabetes organisations standardise and rationalise management. Structured education programmes and psychological support are now well-established as essential for improving patient motivation and self-empowerment. Large multicentre randomised trials have confirmed the effectiveness of intensive glycaemic control on microvascular outcomes, but macrovascular outcomes and cardiovascular safety remain controversial with several glucose-lowering agents. Future directions in diabetes care include strategies such as the ‘bionic pancreas’, stem cell therapy and targeting the intestinal microbiome. All of these treatments are still being refined, and it may be several decades before they are clinically useful. Prevention and cure of diabetes is the Holy Grail but remain elusive due to lack of detailed understanding of the metabolic, genetic and immunological causes that underpin diabetes. Much progress has been made since the time of Prof MacLean 90 years ago, but there are still great strides to be taken before the life of the patient with diabetes improves even more significantly. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

Its more aggressive form is known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, inflammation and often fibrosis. The presence of fibrosis indicates a more aggressive course and may lead to cirrhosis. Premature mortality in NASH is related to both hepatic (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extra-hepatic complications, largely cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many therapeutic agents have been tested, but still none approved specifically for NASH. Treatment of NAFLD includes aggressive management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, although the role of controlling hyperglycemia per se in patients with T2DM and NASH remains unknown. Agents tested with some success in non-diabetic patients with NASH include pioglitazone, liraglutide, vitamin E and to a lesser degree, pentoxiphylline. In patients with T2DM and NASH only pioglitazone has shown to significantly improve liver histology, with only a handful of patients with diabetes having been studied with other modalities. This review focuses on available agents for NASH to assist clinicians in the management of these complex patients. Many novel compounds are being studied and will likely make combination therapy for NASH a reality in the future. © 2016","Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors; Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA); Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); Pioglitazone; Thiazolinediones","Antioxidants; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Risk Factors; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; alpha tocopherol; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antioxidant; betaine; bile acid; colesevelam; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; ezetimibe; fibric acid derivative; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lorcaserin; metformin; omega 3 fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha agonist; phosphodiesterase inhibitor; selenium; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; tetrahydrolipstatin; antidiabetic agent; Article; clinical practice; dietary supplement; human; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); weight reduction; Cardiovascular Diseases; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; risk factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979066985"

Two major neuronal populations present in the arcuate nucleus control caloric intake and energy expenditure: one population co-expresses orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y and the other expresses the anorexigenic anorectic neuropeptides proopiomelanocortin and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (POMC/CART). In addition to integrating signals from neurotransmitters and hormones, the hypothalamic systems that regulate energy homeostasis are affected by nutrients. Fat-rich diets, for instance, elicit hypothalamic inflammation (reactive activation and proliferation of microglia, a condition named gliosis). This process generates resistance to the anorexigenic hormones leptin and insulin, contributing to the genesis of obesity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have increasingly been used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. One compound (liraglutide) was recently approved for the treatment of obesity. Although most studies suggest that GLP-1RAs promote weight loss mainly due to their inhibitory effect on food intake, other central effects that have been described for native GLP-1 and some GLP-1RAs in rodents and humans encourage future clinical trials to explore additional mechanisms that potentially underlie the beneficial effects observed with this drug class. In this article we review the most relevant data exploring the mechanisms involved in the effects of GLP-1RAs in the brain–adipocyte axis. © 2017, The Author(s).","","Adipocytes; Animals; Brain; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; adipocyte; Article; brain; brown adipose tissue; central nervous system; drug effect; drug mechanism; energy balance; human; meta analysis (topic); nonhuman; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); protein function; protein structure; randomized controlled trial (topic); adipocyte; agonists; animal; brain; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; metabolism","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013680031"

We have previously reported that addition of liraglutide for 26 weeks can reverse insulin-associated weight gain, decrease insulin dose and improve glycaemic control, as compared with continuation of standard insulin treatment. Objectives: To investigate whether the beneficial effects of liraglutide are sustained up to 52 weeks and whether similar effects could be obtained when liraglutide is added 6 months later. Methods: Adult T2DM patients with ≥4% weight gain within 16 months of insulin therapy completing the first 26-week trial period of open-label addition of liraglutide 1.8 mg day-1 (n = 26) versus continuation of standard insulin therapy (n = 24) were all treated with liraglutide for another 26 weeks. Results were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Results: Overall, 24 (92%) and 18 (75%) patients originally assigned to liraglutide and standard therapy, respectively, completed the study. Addition of liraglutide decreased body weight to a similar extend when given in the first 26 weeks (liraglutide group) or second 26 weeks (original standard therapy group): -4.4 vs. -4.3 kg (difference -0.32 kg, 95% confidence interval -2.2 to 1.6 kg; P = 0.74). Similar results were also seen in the two groups with regard to decrease in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (-0.77 vs. -0.66%; P = 0.23) and insulin dose (-28 vs. -26 U day-1; P = 0.32). In both groups, 22% of patients could discontinue insulin. Continuation of liraglutide until 52 weeks led to sustained effects on body weight, HbA1c and insulin-dose requirements. Conclusion: In T2DM patients with pronounced insulin-associated weight gain, addition of liraglutide within 2 years leads to sustained reversal of body weight, improved glycaemic control and decrease in insulin dose. Thus, liraglutide offers a valuable therapeutic option. © 2015 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.","Glucagon-like peptide 1; Insulin; Liraglutide; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Weight gain","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Weight Gain; glucagon like peptide 1; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; insulin; liraglutide; abdominal pain; add on therapy; adult; Article; body mass; body weight disorder; clinical article; constipation; controlled study; decreased appetite; diarrhea; drug effect; drug efficacy; dyspepsia; erythema; female; follow up; glucose blood level; glycemic control; headache; health care quality; hip circumference; human; hypoglycemia; injection site reaction; insulin treatment; intention to treat analysis; male; middle aged; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; open study; outcome assessment; physical activity; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; vertigo; vomiting; weight gain; weight reduction; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; time factor; treatment outcome; weight gain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958936016"

In type 2 diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist therapy results in weight reduction. Randomised controlled trials show efficacy in the non-diabetes obese population. Thus we have audited GLP-1 agonist use for weight reduction in morbidly obese people without diabetes. Methods: A protocol for GLP-1 use in non-diabetes obesity (body mass index >35 kg/m2) was agreed with local clinical governance committees. After liraglutide initiation, follow up was monthly, and the dose was up-titrated to a maximal 3 mg daily if indicated. Results: Of 34 people offered treatment, 22 proceeded (age 42 ± 14 years, 17 females, 16 White Caucasians) and 14 completed 12 months of treatment. Absolute weight fell significantly from a baseline of 127 ± 19 kg (n=22) to 121 ± 19 kg (n=22), 119 ± 21 kg (n=21) and 110 ± 15 kg (n=14) kg at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively (all p<0.001 from baseline) amounting to-5.3 ± 4.4 kg,-7.4 ± 7.7 kg and-12.1± 9.6 kg at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively (all p<0.001 from baseline). Conclusions: GLP-1 agonist therapy may play a significant role in people who have failed other weight loss options and are potential candidates for bariatric surgery.","GLP-1 agonists; Morbid obesity","liraglutide; adult; Article; body mass; Caucasian; clinical article; clinical protocol; clinical trial; drug dose titration; drug response; drug safety; female; follow up; human; male; morbid obesity; treatment failure; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963812155"

This post hoc analysis of pooled data from 4 phase 3a trials compared the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo, as adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity, in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic subgroups. Methods: We conducted the double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a minimum body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 with at least 1 comorbidity, or a minimum BMI of 30 kg/m2, at clinical research sites worldwide. In this analysis, we investigated possible differences in treatment effects between 534 Hispanics (10.4% of the population) and 4,597 non-Hispanics (89.6%) through statistical tests of interaction between subgroups and treatment. Variables examined included mean and categorical weight change, cardiovascular risk markers, and safety data. Results: Both subgroups achieved clinically significant mean weight loss at end-of-treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo: Hispanics 7.0% versus 1.5%, treatment difference -5.1% (95% CI, -6.2 to -4.0); non-Hispanics 7.5% versus 2.3%, -5.2% (95% CI, -5.5 to -4.8). More individuals in both subgroups lost ≥5%, >10%, and >15% of their baseline weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg than with placebo. Efficacy endpoints generally did not vary with ethnicity (P>.05). Adverse events were comparable between ethnic subgroups, with more gastrointestinal disorders reported with liraglutide 3.0 mg than placebo. Conclusion: Efficacy and safety were largely similar between Hispanic and non-Hispanic subgroups. Results support that liraglutide 3.0 mg, used with a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity, can facilitate weight loss in Hispanic individuals. © 2016 AACE.","","Adult; Comorbidity; Double-Blind Method; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Overweight; Risk Factors; Weight Loss; liraglutide; placebo; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; liraglutide; adult; Article; body mass; cardiovascular risk; comparative study; constipation; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; ethnicity; female; gastrointestinal disease; Hispanic; human; low calory diet; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nausea; obesity; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); physical activity; post hoc analysis; pulse rate; randomized controlled trial (topic); rhinopharyngitis; risk factor; vomiting; weight change; weight reduction; clinical trial; comorbidity; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug effects; ethnology; Hispanic; obesity; outcome assessment; Overweight; phase 3 clinical trial; randomized controlled trial","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021856177"

The potential role of genetic variability of GLP-1R on body weight response to GLP-1 RAs in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not yet been evaluated. Methods: Fifty-seven obese women with PCOS (aged 30.7∈±∈7.0, BMI 38.6∈±∈5.3 kg/m2) were assigned to liraglutide 1.2 mg QD s.c. for 12 weeks and classified as strong responders regarding weight loss if they lost 5 % or more of their initial body weight. They were genotyped for common GLP-1R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6923761 and rs10305420. Changes of measures of obesity were measured before and at the end of the treatment. Results: Twenty out of 57 subjects were strong responders and lost 7.38∈±∈1.74 compared to 2.11∈±∈2.17 kg lost in poor responders. Carriers of at least one polymorphic rs10305420 allele had poor treatment response compared to carriers of two wild type alleles (OR∈=∈0.27, 95 % CI∈=∈0.09-0.85, P∈=∈0.025). Carriers of at least one polymorphic rs6923761 allele tended to have stronger treatment response compared to carriers of two wild type alleles (OR∈=∈3.06, 95 % CI∈=∈0.96-9.74, P∈=∈0.058). Fasting glucose and glucose after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) comparably decreased in both groups when compared to baseline, whereas no within treatment differences were found in androgen profile. Gastrointestinal adverse events were transit and balanced between strong and poor responders. Conclusions: GLP-1R rs10305420 polymorphism explained some of the inter-individual differences in response to liraglutide regarding weight loss in obese PCOS women. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Liraglutide; Obesity; PCOS; Poor responders GLP-1 receptor polymorphism; Strong responders","Adult; Female; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Incretins; Liraglutide; Logistic Models; Obesity; Odds Ratio; Phenotype; Pilot Projects; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Slovenia; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; Young Adult; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; liraglutide; GLP1R protein, human; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; incretin; liraglutide; adult; allele; Article; body weight; drug dose increase; drug dose titration; female; gastrointestinal symptom; genetic variability; genotype; headache; human; hypoglycemia; individuality; injection site rash; insomnia; major clinical study; nausea; obesity; ovary polycystic disease; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; treatment duration; treatment response; weight reduction; agonists; clinical trial; drug effects; gene frequency; genetics; obesity; odds ratio; phenotype; pilot study; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; single nucleotide polymorphism; Slovenia; statistical model; treatment outcome; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930870688"

The mechanisms by which liraglutide confers weight loss remain to be fully clarified. Thus, we investigated whether GLP-1 receptors are expressed in human brains and whether liraglutide administration affects neural responses to food cues in diabetic individuals (primary outcome). Methods: In 22 consecutively studied human brains, expression of GLP-1 receptors in the hypothalamus, medulla oblongata and parietal cortex was examined using immunohistochemistry. In a randomised (assigned by the pharmacy using a randomisation enrolment table), placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, 21 individuals with type 2 diabetes (18 included in analysis due to lack or poor quality of data) were treated with placebo and liraglutide for a total of 17 days each (0.6 mg for 7 days, 1.2 mg for 7 days, and 1.8 mg for 3 days). Participants were eligible if they had type 2 diabetes and were currently being treated with lifestyle changes or metformin. Participants, caregivers, people doing measurements and/or examinations, and people assessing the outcomes were blinded to the medication assignment. We studied metabolic changes as well as neurocognitive and neuroimaging (functional MRI) of responses to food cues at the clinical research centre of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Results: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of GLP-1 receptors on neurons in the human hypothalamus, medulla and parietal cortex. Liraglutide decreased activation of the parietal cortex in response to highly desirable (vs less desirable) food images (p < 0.001; effect size: placebo 0.53 ± 0.24, liraglutide −0.47 ± 0.18). No significant adverse effects were noted. In a secondary analysis, we observed decreased activation in the insula and putamen, areas involved in the reward system. Furthermore, we showed that increased ratings of hunger and appetite correlated with increased brain activation in response to highly desirable food cues while on liraglutide, while ratings of nausea correlated with decreased brain activation. Conclusions/interpretation: For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of GLP-1 receptors in human brains. We also observe that liraglutide alters brain activity related to highly desirable food cues. Our data point to a central mechanism contributing to, or underlying, the effects of liraglutide on metabolism and weight loss. Future studies will be needed to confirm and extend these findings in larger samples of diabetic individuals and/or with the higher doses of liraglutide (3 mg) recently approved for obesity.

In this study our aim was to assess the effects of six months treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg od on obesity, and CV risk markers, particularly platelet function, in young obese women with PCOS compared to controls of similar age and weight. Methods: Carotid intima-media wall thickness (cIMT) was measured by B-mode ultrasonography, platelet function by flow cytometry, clot structure/lysis by turbidimetric assays and endothelial function by ELISA and post-ischaemic reactive hyperemia (RHI). Data presented as mean change (6-month - baseline) ± standard deviation. Results: Nineteen obese women with PCOS and 17 controls, of similar age and weight, were recruited; baseline atherothrombotic risk markers did not differ between the two groups. Twenty five (69.4%) participants completed the study (13 PCOS, 12 controls). At six months, weight was significantly reduced by 3.0 ± 4.2 and 3.8 ± 3.4 kg in the PCOS and control groups, respectively; with no significant difference between the two groups, P = 0.56. Similarly, HOMA-IR, triglyceride, hsCRP, urinary isoprostanes, serum endothelial adhesion markers (sP-selectin, sICAM and sVCAM), and clot lysis area were equally significantly reduced in both groups compared to baseline. Basal platelet P-selectin expression was significantly reduced at six months in controls -0.17 ± 0.26 but not PCOS -0.12 ± 0.28; between groups difference, 95% confidence interval = -0.14 - 0.26, P = 0.41. No significant changes were noted in cIMT or RHI. Conclusions: Six months treatment with liraglutide (1.8 mg od) equally affected young obese women with PCOS and controls. In both groups, liraglutide treatment was associated with 3-4% weight loss and significant reduction in atherothrombosis markers including inflammation, endothelial function and clotting. Our data support the use of liraglutide as weight loss medication in simple obesity and suggest a potential beneficial effect on platelet function and atherothrombotic risk at 6 months of treatment. © Kahal et al.","cIMT; Liraglutide; Obesity; PCOS; Platelet function","Adolescent; Adult; Blood Platelets; Cardiovascular Diseases; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Female; Fibrinolysis; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Liraglutide; Middle Aged; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Risk Factors; Young Adult; fibrinogen; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; isoprostane derivative; liraglutide; PADGEM protein; triacylglycerol; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; arterial wall thickness; Article; atherothrombotic risk; B scan; blood clot lysis; blood clotting; body mass; cardiovascular risk; carotid artery; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; flow cytometry; human; hyperemia; major clinical study; obesity; ovary polycystic disease; thrombocyte activation; thrombocyte function; thrombosis; weight reduction; adolescent; adult; analogs and derivatives; Cardiovascular Diseases; complication; drug effects; fibrinolysis; insulin resistance; middle aged; physiology; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; risk factor; thrombocyte; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926343937"

Traditional treatments (sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones) of diabetes are associated with weight gain, except metformin. Newer agents such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are causing a modest weight reduction, whereas dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are weight neutral. Oxyntomodulin, a native GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist produced a superior weight loss and antihyperglycemic effects in obese mice and humans. Recent findings with synthetic dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonists have shown a good weight loss and antihyperglycemic profile in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Targeting combinations of GLP-1 receptor and glucagon receptor simultaneously with a single peptide may be the better strategy to achieve marked weight loss and considerable glycemic control in diabesity. Cardiovascular safety is very important with new antidiabetic agents due to rosiglitazone controversy. Current on-going clinical trials will clarify the cardiovascular effects of incretin-based therapies in near future. Based on current knowledge and rapid progress in the field, there is a strong possibility that the GLP-1/glucagon receptor co-agonists will likely be the new therapeutic treatment for diabesity for decades to come. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Co-agonist; Diabesity; Glucagon; Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1); Oxyntomodulin","Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Diabetes Complications; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Glucagon; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Mice; Mice, Obese; Obesity; Oxyntomodulin; Peptides; Rats; Recombinant Proteins; Thiazolidinediones; Transcription, Genetic; Venoms; albiglutide; ari 1732ts; dulaglutide; efpeglenatide; exendin 4; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; glymera; hm 2525a; iub 447; liraglutide; lixisenatide; ly 2944876; medi 0382; mod 6030; mod 6031; oxyntomodulin; pb 1023; sar 425899; semaglutide; taspoglutide; tt 401; ttp 273; unclassified drug; vpd 107; vrs 859; zp 2929; zyog 1; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; exendin 4; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; oxyntomodulin; peptide; recombinant protein; rosiglitazone; venom; Article; diabetic obesity; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug tolerability; energy expenditure; glycemic control; high risk patient; human; hyperglycemia; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); treatment duration; weight reduction; agonists; animal; clinical trial (topic); complication; diabetic complication; genetic transcription; metabolism; mouse; mouse mutant; obesity; rat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982296136"

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software package version 11.5 for Windows.Results:Liraglutide treatment caused significant reduction of the mean body weight (from 86.61±14.09 to 79.10±13.55 kg) and waist circumference (from 101.81±13.96 to 94.29±14.17 cm), resulting in body weight lose of 5%-10% in 43.67% patients, and body weight loss above 10% in 34.06% patients, who had significant lower plasma creatinine levels. Baseline waist circumference, BMI and HOMA-IR were independently correlated with the body weight loss. Furthermore, liraglutide treatment significantly decreased HbA1c levels (from 8.66%±2.17% to 6.92%±0.95%) with HbA1c<7.0% in 35.37% patients, who had a significantly lower baseline level of HbA1c, but higher baseline levels of C peptide and glucagon. Moreover, liraglutide treatment resulted in greater body weight loss in patients with a long duration of diabetes, and better glycemic control in patients with a short duration of diabetes.Conclusion:Liraglutide significantly reduces body weight and waist circumference in Chinese overweight and obese type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with apparent visceral obesity, insulin resistance and a long duration of diabetes may have greater body weight loss; whereas patients with high insulin-secreting ability, hyperglucagonemia, and short-duration diabetes may obtain better glycemic control with liraglutide. © 2015 CPS and SIMM.","body weight; Chinese type 2 diabetic patients; creatinine; diabetes; glucagon; HbA1c'C peptide; Liraglutide; obesity; waist circumference","Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Waist Circumference; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; C peptide; creatinine; glimepiride; glucagon; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; voglibose; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; abdominal distension; add on therapy; adult; Article; body mass; Chinese; constipation; creatinine blood level; diabetic patient; diarrhea; disease duration; female; follow up; glucagon blood level; glucose blood level; glycemic control; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypoglycemia; insulin resistance; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; open study; pancreas islet cell function; waist circumference; weight control; weight reduction; analogs and derivatives; Asian continental ancestry group; body weight; clinical trial; drug effects; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Overweight; pathophysiology; waist circumference","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961313241"

Liraglutide causes a glucose-dependent increase in insulin secretion, decreases glucagon secretion and promotes weight loss by inhibiting appetite. Liraglutide probably induces satiety through activation of different areas in the hind brain and possibly by preserving free leptin levels. Recently, liraglutide has been suggested to protect against prediabetes and seems to prevent bone loss by increasing bone formation following diet-induced weight loss in obesity.

Liraglutide, a glucagonlike peptide-1 analogue, has been shown to have potential benefit for weight management at a once-daily dose of 3.0 mg, injected subcutaneously. METHODS We conducted a 56-week, double-blind trial involving 3731 patients who did not have type 2 diabetes and who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of at least 30 or a BMI of at least 27 if they had treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension. We randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg (2487 patients) or placebo (1244 patients); both groups received counseling on lifestyle modification. The coprimary end points were the change in body weight and the proportions of patients losing at least 5% and more than 10% of their initial body weight. RESULTS At baseline, the mean (±SD) age of the patients was 45.1±12.0 years, the mean weight was 106.2±21.4 kg, and the mean BMI was 38.3±6.4; a total of 78.5% of the patients were women and 61.2% had prediabetes. At week 56, patients in the liraglutide group had lost a mean of 8.4±7.3 kg of body weight, and those in the placebo group had lost a mean of 2.8±6.5 kg (a difference of -5.6 kg; 95% confidence interval, -6.0 to -5.1; P<0.001, with last-observation-carried-forward imputation). A total of 63.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group as compared with 27.1% in the placebo group lost at least 5% of their body weight (P<0.001), and 33.1% and 10.6%, respectively, lost more than 10% of their body weight (P<0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events with liraglutide were mild or moderate nausea and diarrhea. Serious events occurred in 6.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group and in 5.0% of the patients in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS In this study, 3.0 mg of liraglutide, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, was associated with reduced body weight and improved metabolic control.

Whether lowering of glucose levels during hip surgery diminishes coagulation activation is unknown. We investigated the efficacy of the human GLP-1 analogue liraglutide to lower glucose during and after hip surgery and studied its influence on coagulation activation. Methods: A total of 37 obese subjects who underwent hip surgery were randomized to subcutaneous liraglutide or placebo for 4 consecutive days, starting one day prior to surgery. Glucose levels and coagulation indices at three fixed time-points (pre-operative, 2. h post-operative and 3. days post-operative) were measured. Results: Liraglutide reduced glucose at day three post-surgery (median glucose (IQR) liraglutide 5.5 (5.2-5.7) vs. placebo 5.8 (5.5-6.2); difference 0.3. mmol/L, P=. 0.04). Changes in 6 out of 8 coagulation indices studied did not differ between the two groups. Only D-dimer levels were significantly lower in the liraglutide group at day three post-surgery and FVIII levels were significantly higher in the liraglutide group 2. h post-surgery. Conclusion: Although the human GLP-1 analogue liraglutide moderately reduced post-operative blood glucose levels in non-diabetic and prediabetic obese patients undergoing elective hip surgery, no changes were observed with respect to coagulation activation. © 2015 The Authors.","Blood coagulation; Glucagon-like peptide 1; Hyperglycaemia; Peri-operative period; Venous thromboembolism","alpha 2 antiplasmin; blood clotting factor 8; D dimer; dabigatran; glucose; liraglutide; placebo; thrombin antithrombin complex; von Willebrand factor; adult; aged; appetite disorder; Article; blood clotting; clinical article; dizziness; drug dose escalation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; glucose blood level; headache; hip surgery; human; hyperglycemia; male; morning dosage; nausea; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; vomiting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925101632"

We decide to investigate the role of this polymorphism on metabolic changes and weight loss secondary to treatment with liraglutide. Material and methods A population of 90 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and overweight, unable to achieve glycemic control (HbA1c > 7%) with metformin alone that require initiation of liraglutide treatment in progressive dose to 1.8 mg/day subcutaneously, was analyzed. Results Fifty one patients (56.7%) had the genotype GG and 39 (43.3%) patients; GA (30 patients, 33.3%) or AA (9 patients, 10%) (A allele carriers). In patients with both genotypes, body mass index (BMI), weight and fat decreased. The proportion of the mentioned reductions was higher in the variant allele carriers; BMI (- 0.59 ± 2.5 kg/m2 vs. - 1.69 ± 3.9 kg/m2; P < 0.05), weight (- 2.78 ± 2.8 kg vs. - 4.52 ± 4.6 kg; P < 0.05) and fat mass (- 0.59 ± 2.5 kg vs. - 1.69 ± 3.9 kg; P < 0.05). Weight reduction after liraglutide treatment was greater in the A-allele carriers by 2.9 kg (95% CI: 0.27-5.64). The decrease of basal glucose, HOMA-R and HbA1c was similar in both genotypes. Conclusion Our data showed better anthropometric parameters in overweight diabetic subjects with the variant allele (A) of rs6923761 GLP-1 R polymorphism. A allele carriers had a greater decrease in weight and fat mass after treatment with liraglutide. The present study is a preliminary observation, and its results need to be replicated with a higher number of patients in different populations. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Few safe, effective weight-management drugs are currently available. Objective: To investigate efficacy and safety of liraglutide vs placebo for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Fifty-six-week randomized (2:1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with 12-week observational off-drug follow-up period. The study was conducted at 126 sites in 9 countries between June 2011 and January 2013. Of 1361 participants assessed for eligibility, 846 were randomized. Inclusion criteria were body mass index of 27.0 or greater, age 18 years or older, taking 0 to 3 oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin, thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea) with stable body weight, and glycated hemoglobin level 7.0% to 10.0%. Interventions: Once-daily, subcutaneous liraglutide (3.0mg) (n = 423), liraglutide (1.8mg) (n = 211), or placebo (n = 212), all as adjunct to 500 kcal/d dietary deficit and increased physical activity (≥150 min/wk). Main Outcomes and Measures: Three coprimary end points: relative change inweight, proportion of participants losing 5% or more, or more than 10%, of baselineweight atweek 56. Results: Baseline weight was 105.7 kg with liraglutide (3.0-mg dose), 105.8 kg with liraglutide (1.8-mg dose), and 106.5 kg with placebo. Weight loss was 6.0% (6.4 kg) with liraglutide (3.0-mg dose), 4.7% (5.0 kg) with liraglutide (1.8-mg dose), and 2.0% (2.2 kg) with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0mg] vs placebo, -4.00% [95% CI, -5.10% to -2.90%]; liraglutide [1.8mg] vs placebo, -2.71% [95% CI, -4.00% to -1.42%]; P < .001 for both). Weight loss of 5% or greater occurred in 54.3% with liraglutide (3.0mg) and 40.4% with liraglutide (1.8mg) vs 21.4% with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0mg] vs placebo, 32.9% [95% CI, 24.6% to 41.2%]; for liraglutide [1.8mg] vs placebo, 19.0% [95% CI, 9.1% to 28.8%]; P < .001 for both). Weight loss greater than 10% occurred in 25.2% with liraglutide (3.0mg) and 15.9% with liraglutide (1.8mg) vs 6.7% with placebo (estimated difference for liraglutide [3.0mg] vs placebo, 18.5% [95% CI, 12.7% to 24.4%], P < .001; for liraglutide [1.8mg] vs placebo, 9.3% [95% CI, 2.7% to 15.8%], P = .006). More gastrointestinal disorders were reported with liraglutide (3.0mg) vs liraglutide (1.8mg) and placebo. No pancreatitis was reported. Conclusions and Relevance: Among overweight and obese participants with type 2 diabetes, use of subcutaneous liraglutide (3.0mg) daily, compared with placebo, resulted inweight loss over 56weeks. Further studies are needed to evaluate longer-term efficacy and safety. Copyright © 2015 American Medical Association.

However, its several other metabolic properties are still controversial. Given this background, the aims of the present study are to evaluate the effects of 24-week liraglutide treatment on body composition, appetite, and lipid profile in overweight and obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Methods: A cohort study was carried out on overweight and obese T2DM patients with glycosylated hemoglobin A1c equal to 6% (42 mmol/mol)-10% (86 mmol/mol), under a 3-month treatment (at least) with maximal dose of metformin as stable regime, by adding liraglutide at doses up to 3 mg/d. Body composition markers were measured by dual-energy X-ray densitometry at baseline and after 24 weeks of liraglutide treatment. Glucose control was monitored by glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment. Finally, the appetite sensation and plasma lipids were also evaluated. Results: Twenty-eight subjects (male/female: 16/12, mean age: 58.75±9.33 years, body mass index: 34.13±5.46 kg/m2) were evaluated. Accounting for the adjustment for age, sex, and duration of diabetes, we noted significant decreases in body mass index (-0.86 kg/m2, P=0.024), fat mass (-2.01 kg, P=0.015), fat mass index (-0.71 kg/m2, P=0.014), android fat (-1.72%, P=0.022), trunk fat (-1.52%, P=0.016), and waist circumference (-6.86 cm, P,0.001) from the baseline values. Haber score was increased by 3.82 units (P=0.009), and the number of metabolic syndrome risk factors was decreased (-0.69 units, P=0.012). The glucose control variables and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio also showed significant decreases from baseline values. Conclusion: The 24-week liraglutide treatment leads to the reduction of fat mass, android fat, trunk fat, and appetite by improving the lipid profile, glucose control, and insulin sensitivity. © 2016 Rondanelli et al.","Appetite; Body composition; Fat mass; Liraglutide; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Weight loss","cholesterol; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; lipid; liraglutide; metformin; adult; appetite; Article; blood glucose monitoring; body composition; body fat; body mass; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug effect; fat mass; female; glycemic control; human; lipid blood level; male; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; treatment duration; waist circumference","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962050733"

Research was conducted by looking at anti-obesity therapies currently on the market or in clinical trials (phases I to III) conducted from 1998 to September 2014, with the exclusion of any drugs whose phase I trial was conducted prior to January 1998. This was completed primarily through a search on http://clinicaltrials.gov where a total of 51 drugs met the search criteria. The transition probabilities were then calculated based on various classifications and compared against industry standards. The transition probability of anti-obesity agents was 8.50% whereas the transition probability of industry standards was 10.40%. Combination therapies had four times the transition probability than monotherapies, 40% and 4.75%, respectively. Therefore, it was determined that 92% of drugs fail during clinical trial testing for this indication and combination therapy appears to improve clinical trial success rates to 10-fold. © 2015 World Obesity.","Anti-obesity agents; Clinical trials; Combination therapies","Anti-Obesity Agents; Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Drug Design; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Obesity; Treatment Failure; amfebutamone; antiobesity agent; cannabinoid receptor; liraglutide; lorcaserin; phentermine plus topiramate; antiobesity agent; Article; bariatric surgery; drug program; human; monotherapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); probability; therapy; weight reduction; combination drug therapy; complication; drug design; obesity; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); treatment failure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938683124"

We studied 30 obese patients, including 10 with type 2 diabetes, 8 with impaired glucose tolerance, and 12 with normal glucose tolerance before, 1 wk, and 3 mo after RYGB, using an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) to estimate first-phase insulin response, insulin sensitivity (Si), and glucose effectiveness with Bergman's minimal model. In the fasting state, insulin sensitivity was estimated by HOMA-S and β-cell function by HOMA-β. Moreover, mixed-meal tests and oral GTTs were performed. In patients with type 2 diabetes, glucose levels normalized after RYGB, first-phase insulin secretion in response to iv glucose increased twofold, and HOMA-β already improved 1 wk postoperatively, with further enhancements at 3 mo. Insulin sensitivity increased in the liver (HOMA-S) at 1 wk and at 3 mo in peripheral tissues (Si), whereas glucose effectiveness did not improve significantly. During oral testing, GLP-1 responses and insulin secretion increased regardless of glucose tolerance. Therefore, in addition to increased insulin sensitivity and exaggerated postprandial GLP-1 levels, diabetes remission after RYGB involves early improvement of pancreatic β-cell function per se, reflected in enhanced first-phase insulin secretion to iv glucose and increased HOMA-β. A major role for improved glucose effectiveness after RYGB was not supported by this study. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.","First-phase insulin secretion; Glucose effectiveness; Insulin sensitivity; Type 2 diabetes; β-cell function","Adult; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fasting; Gastric Bypass; Glucose Intolerance; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Insulin; Middle Aged; Obesity; Postoperative Period; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glimepiride; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; sitagliptin; glucose blood level; insulin; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; body weight; cell function; comorbidity; female; glucose tolerance; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin release; insulin response; insulin sensitivity; intravenous glucose tolerance test; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oral glucose tolerance test; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; Roux en Y gastric bypass; stomach bypass; controlled study; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; diet restriction; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance test; metabolism; middle aged; obesity; physiology; postoperative period; randomized controlled trial; rehabilitation; secretion (process)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930897612"

However, the complexity of energy balance regulation, combined with the heterologous pathophysiology of human obesity, renders effective medicinal intervention very difficult. Indeed, the search for the silver bullet in anti-obesity medicines has been laden with drugs of underwhelming efficacy and unacceptable side effects. This can partly be the consequence that many of these drug interventions have been historically directed at single molecular targets. New multi-molecular combination therapies have shown promising clinical outcomes in terms of weight loss, yet multi-functional single molecules may offer even more advantages than adjunctive co-treatments. Single molecules with integrated activities derived from multiple hormones involved in the physiological control of metabolism have emerged as one of the more promising candidates for reversing obesity. The inclusion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) as one of the constituents is a unifying factor amongst the majority of these unimolecular multi-agonists.

GLP-1 agonists, including liraglutide, have emerged as effective therapies for type 2 diabetes (DM) and obesity. Here, we attempted to delineate how liraglutide, at doses approved for DM, may impact circulating hormones influencing energy homeostasis in diabetics. Basic Procedures. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial of 20 patients with type 2 diabetes, we examined the effects of liraglutide as compared to placebo on fasting levels of circulating hormones important to energy homeostasis, including leptin, ghrelin, PYY, and GIP. After 17 days (0.6 mg for 7 days, 1.2 mg for 7 days and 1.8 mg for 3 days) of treatment, we also studied changes in fMRI responses to food cues. Main Findings. By design, to avoid any confounding by weight changes, subjects were studied for 17 days, i.e. before body weight changed. Participants on liraglutide had significantly increased GLP-1 levels (p < 0.001), decreased percent change in leptin levels (p < 0.01) and increased GIP levels (p < 0.03) in comparison to placebo treated subjects. Whole brain regressions of functional activity in response to food cues reveal that increased GIP levels were associated with deactivation of the attention- and reward-related insula. Decreases in leptin levels were associated with activations in the reward-related midbrain, precuneus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and sensorimotor-related motor cortex and with deactivations in the attention-related parietal cortex and the cognitive control-related thalamus and pre-SMA. Principal Conclusions. We demonstrate herein short-term changes to circulating levels of GIP and leptin in response to GLP-1 agonist liraglutide therapy. These findings suggest that liraglutide may alter the circulating levels of hormones important in energy homeostasis that, in turn, influence CNS perception of food cues. This could possibly lead to compensatory changes in energy homeostasis that could over time limit the efficacy of liraglutide to decrease body weight. These novel findings, which, pointing to the potential advantages of combination therapies, may have therapeutic implications, will need to be confirmed by larger and longer-term trials. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Previous interventions designed to counteract antipsychotic-induced weight gain and cardiometabolic disturbances reported limited effects. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide added to clozapine or olanzapine treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical double-blind trial enrolled participants at 2 clinical sites in Denmark. Of 214 eligible participants with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 103 were randomized to liraglutide or placebo. Participants received stable treatment with clozapine or olanzapine, were overweight or obese, and had prediabetes. Data were collected from May 1, 2013, through February 25, 2016. INTERVENTIONS Treatment for 16 weeks with once-daily subcutaneous injection of liraglutide or placebo. Trial drug therapy was titrated during the first 2 weeks of the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end pointwas change in glucose tolerance estimated by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test result. Secondary end points included change in body weight and cardiometabolic parameters. RESULTS Ofthe103patientsundergoingrandomization(60men[58.3%]and43women[41.7%]), 97were included in the efficacy analysis, with amean(SD) age of42.5 (10.5) years andmean(SD) bodymassindex(calculatedasweightinkilogramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared)of33.8(5.9). The liraglutide and placebo groups had comparable characteristics (mean [SD] age, 42.1 [10.7] vs 43.0[10.5] years; 30 men in each group; mean [SD] body mass index, 33.7 [5.1] vs 33.9 [6.6]). Atotal of96randomized participants (93.2%) completed the trial. Glucose tolerance improvedin the liraglutidegroupcomparedwith theplacebogroup(P< .001). Altogether, 30liraglutide-treated participants (63.8%) developed normal glucose tolerance compared with 8 placebo-treated participants (16.0%)(P < .001;numberneededto treat, 2).Bodyweight decreased with liraglutide compared with placebo (-5.3 kg; 95%CI, -7.0to -3.7 kg). Reductions inwaist circumference (-4.1 cm; 95%CI, -6.0to -2.3 cm), systolic blood pressure (-4.9mmHg; 95%CI, -9.5 to -0.3mmHg), visceral fat (-250.19 g; 95%CI, -459.9 to -40.5 g), and low-density lipoprotein levels (-15.4mg/dL;95%CI, -23.2to-7.7mg/dL) occurred with liraglutidecomparedwith placebo. Adverse events with liraglutide affected mainly the gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Liraglutide significantly improved glucose tolerance, body weight, and cardiometabolic disturbances in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders treated with clozapine or olanzapine. © 2017 American Medical Association.

Study design This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-one subjects, aged 12-17 years and Tanner stage 2-5, with obesity (body mass index [BMI] corresponding to both a BMI ≥95th percentile for age and sex and to a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 for adults; additionally, BMI was ≤45 kg/m2) were randomized (2:1) to receive 5 weeks of treatment with liraglutide (0.6 mg with weekly dose increase to a maximum of 3.0 mg for the last week) (n = 14) or placebo (n = 7). The primary endpoint was number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints included safety measures, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Results All participants receiving liraglutide, and 4 receiving placebo (57.1%), had at least 1 TEAE. The most common TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders. No severe TEAEs, TEAE-related withdrawals, or deaths occurred. Twelve hypoglycemic episodes occurred in 8 participants receiving liraglutide and 2 in 1 participant receiving placebo. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported. Liraglutide exposure in terms of trough concentration increased with dose, although dose proportionality was confounded by unexpectedly low trough concentration values at the 2.4 mg dose. Exposure in terms of model-derived area under the plasma concentration time curve from 0 to 24 hours after dose in steady state was similar to that in adults with obesity. Conclusions Liraglutide had a similar safety and tolerability profile compared with adults when administered to adolescents with obesity, with no unexpected safety/tolerability issues. Results suggest that the dosing regimen approved for weight management in adults may be appropriate for use in adolescents.

Objective To evaluate GLP-1 RA treatment on body weight, glycaemic control and total daily insulin dose in obese, insulin-using type 2 diabetes patients after 2 years follow-up in a real life setting and to explore a possible relation with eating behaviour. Setting The Martini Hospital and the University Medical Center in Groningen in the Netherlands. Methods Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age, were on insulin therapy and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2), started GLP-1 RA treatment. At baseline eating behaviour was classified according to the validated Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. A 2 years follow-up was performed. Main outcome measures Body weight, HbA1c and total daily insulin dose. Results 151 Patients started with exenatide or liraglutide. 120 patients completed the 2 years follow-up. From baseline to 2 years, body weight (mean ± SD) changed from 117.9 ± 22.1 to 107.9 ± 22.9 kg (P < 0.0001), HbA1c (median, IQR) changed from 7.9 (7.2–8.9) to 7.6 (6.9–8.3) % [63 (55–74) to 60 (52–67) mmol/mol] (P < 0.0001), total daily insulin dose changed from 90 (56–150) to 60 (0–100) Units/day (P < 0.0001). Weight change differed between eating behaviour groups (P < 0.001) in which external eating behaviour (n = 17) resulted in the smallest decline (−3.1 %) and restrained (n = 41) in the greatest (−10.3 %) in comparison with emotional (n = 37, −8.5 %) and indifferent (n = 25, −9.6 %) eating behaviours. Conclusion Two year of GLP-1 RA treatment resulted in a sustained reduction of weight, HbA1c and total daily insulin dose in obese, insulin-using type 2 diabetes patients in a real life setting. Largest weight loss was achieved in patients with a predominant restraint eating pattern while a predominant external eating pattern resulted in the smallest weight reduction. © 2015, The Author(s).","Diabetes mellitus; Eating behaviour; GLP-1 receptor agonist; Insulin therapy; Weight loss","Aged; Anti-Obesity Agents; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Therapy, Combination; Feeding Behavior; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Insulin; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Obesity; Peptides; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Venoms; Weight Loss; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; biological marker; exendin 4; GLP1R protein, human; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; incretin; insulin; liraglutide; peptide; venom; adult; Article; behavior assessment; behavior change; body mass; controlled study; disease duration; drug effect; drug response; feeding behavior; female; follow up; glycemic control; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Netherlands; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; outcome assessment; priority journal; social interaction; treatment duration; weight change; aged; agonists; blood; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; feeding behavior; glucose blood level; metabolism; multicenter study; obesity; pathophysiology; prospective study; psychology; questionnaire; time factor; treatment outcome; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956612706"

We performed a systematic review to evaluate its weight loss effect on obese/overweight patients without diabetes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Literature updated to May 5, 2014 from Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists from relevant articles were identified. RCTs with GLP-1 mimetics treating obese/overweight adults without diabetes for at least 12 weeks were assessed. Studies lacking primary measurements were excluded. Three authors extracted data independently. Either fixed-effect or random-effect models were used to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs), combined relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in meta-analyses. Intertrial heterogeneity across studies was examined by I2 and Q statistics. Results: A total of 1345 individuals retrieved from eight studies were involved and all included trials were of mild-to-moderate bias risks. Participants in GLP-1RA groups achieved a larger weight loss than those in control groups (-2.85kg, 95%CI -3.55 to -2.14), and liraglutide may work in a dose-dependent fashion. GLP-1RAs also reduced body mass index (BMI) and waist circumferences (WC) and benefited systolic blood pressure and triglyceride regulation. But GLP-1RAs were associated with increased nausea and vomiting events. Conclusions: GLP-1 mimetics induce a weight loss in addition to BMI and WC reduction in obese/overweight adults without diabetes. Further long-term randomized trials and basic studies are required to investigate the mechanisms. © 2014 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 mimetics; Meta-analysis; Non-diabetes; Obesity; Weight loss","Adult; Biomimetics; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Obesity; Overweight; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Receptors, Glucagon; Weight Loss; adiponectin; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon receptor; adult; Article; body mass; Cochrane Library; controlled study; diarrhea; drug efficacy; Embase; human; hypoglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; information retrieval; lipid analysis; major clinical study; Medline; meta analysis; nausea and vomiting; obesity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; weight change; weight reduction; agonists; biomimetics; drug effects; obesity; Overweight; randomized controlled trial (topic); weight reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928211618"

However, it is unknown how these metabolites are affected by weight loss, and during weight-maintaining treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). Objective: We aimed to characterize changes in metabolites related to protein turnover and glycolysis after a weight loss intervention followed by long term weight maintenance with/without GLP-1 RA. Methods: Fifty-eight obese individuals underwent a diet-induced 12 % body weight loss during 8 weeks. Participants were randomized to weight maintenance with or without administration of the GLP-1 RA liraglutide (1.2 mg/day) for 52 weeks. Metabolomic profiling by high-throughput proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used for quantification of metabolites. Results: The weight loss was maintained in both groups and was associated with 9–20 % decreases in plasma concentrations of alanine, phenylalanine, histidine, tyrosine and the BCAAs leucine, isoleucine and valine (p < 0.05). Plasma citrate levels increased during weight loss (p = 5.2 × 10−15) and showed inverse correlation with insulin resistance measured by HOMA–IR levels (r = −0.318, p = 0.025). Valine concentrations were lower in the control group compared to the GLP-1RA group during weight maintenance (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Weight loss is associated with marked changes in plasma concentrations of eight amino acids and glycolysis-related metabolites. Levels of the suggested type 2 diabetes risk markers (BCAAs) remain low during long-term weight maintenance. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Branched chain amino acids; Liraglutide; Metabolomics; Weight loss","alanine; branched chain amino acid; citric acid; histidine; isoleucine; leucine; liraglutide; phenylalanine; tyrosine; valine; adult; aged; amino acid blood level; Article; body weight management; comparative study; controlled study; female; glycolysis; human; insulin resistance; low calory diet; major clinical study; metabolomics; obesity; protein metabolism; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; randomized controlled trial; weight reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992358956"

Type 2 diabetic patients with insulin treatment were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, comparative study. Participants were randomly assigned to liraglutide plus insulin (liraglutide group) and insulin treatment (control group) at 1:1 allocation. Primary endpoint was the change in viscera fat are (VFA, cm2) at 24 weeks. Liver attenuation index (LAI) measured by abdominal computed tomography, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR, mg/g), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, skeletal muscle index (SMI), and quality of life (QOL) related to diabetes treatment were also determined. Seventeen patients (8; liraglutide group, 9; control group, mean age 59 ± 13 years; 53% female) completed this study. Liraglutide treatment significantly reduced VFA at 24 weeks; whereas, SFA was unchanged. ACR, LAI, and CRP levels were significantly reduced by liraglutide at 24 weeks and there was no difference in SMI between the two groups. Changes in VFA from baseline to 24 weeks were significantly associated with those in LAI, albuminuria, and HbA1c. Liraglutide treatment significantly improved QOL scores associated with anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment and satisfaction with treatment. No severe adverse events were observed in both groups. Our data suggest that liraglutide could reduce visceral adiposity in parallel with attenuation of hepatic fat accumulation, albuminuria and micro-inflammation and improve QOL related to diabetes care in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. © The Japan Endocrine Society.","Albuminuria; GLP1; Hepatic steatosis; Micro-inflammation; Visceral fat","Adiposity; Albuminuria; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; Diabetic Nephropathies; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Japan; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Risk; albumin; C reactive protein; creatinine; insulin; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; insulin; liraglutide; adult; albuminuria; anxiety; Article; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; fatty liver; female; human; inflammation; intraperitoneal fat; male; microalbuminuria; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; open study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; skeletal muscle; student satisfaction; unspecified side effect; albuminuria; Cardiovascular Diseases; combination drug therapy; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; Diabetic Cardiomyopathies; Diabetic Nephropathies; drug effects; follow up; immunology; intraabdominal fat; Japan; middle aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; obesity; pathology; pathophysiology; patient satisfaction; risk","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016606554"

In overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes, modest and sustained weight loss has been shown to improve glycemic control and to reduce the need for glucose-lowering medications (3-5). Small studies have demonstrated that in obese patients with type 2 diabetes more extreme dietary energy restriction with very low-calorie diets can reduce A1C to ,6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and fasting glucose to,126mg/dL (7.0mmol/L) in the absence of pharmacological therapy or ongoing procedures (7,9,10). Weight loss-induced improvements in glycemia are most likely to occur early in the natural history of type 2 diabetes when obesityassociated insulin resistance has caused reversible b-cell dysfunction but insulin secretory capacity remains relatively preserved (5,8,10).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS For this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial, 55 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and/or sulfonylurea agents were included. Participants received liraglutide 1.8 mg (n = 19), sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 19), ormatching placebos (n = 17) once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was change in exocrine function (intraduodenal pancreatic fluid secretion, lipase activity, fecal elastase-1, and chymotrypsin). Secondary end points included changes in plasma enzyme concentrations and pancreatic morphology (per MRI). RESULTS No patient developed pancreatitis. Sitagliptin increased intraduodenal pancreatic fluid secretion by 16.3 mL (95% CI 20.3 to 32.9; P = 0.05), whereas liraglutide did not change exocrine pancreatic function. Neither therapy increased lipase/ amylase levels after 12 weeks. However, liraglutide increased lipase levels after 6 weeks (23.5 U/L [95% CI 2.1-44.8]; P = 0.03) and sitagliptin increased amylase levels after 2 and 6 weeks (13.7 U/L [95% CI 3.4-23.9]; P = 0.03). Both drugs increased plasma trypsinogen after 12 weeks (liraglutide: 34.6 mg/mL [95% CI 15.1-54.2], P = 0.001; sitagliptin: 23.9 mg/mL [95% CI 4.9-42.9], P = 0.01). Neither changed pancreatic morphology, although liraglutide tended to increase pancreatic volume (7.7 cm3 [95% CI 21.2 to 16.6]; P = 0.09). Treatment-induced volume expansion was associated with increased amylase levels. CONCLUSIONS A 12-week treatment with liraglutide or sitagliptin only resulted in a brief and modest increase of plasma pancreatic enzyme concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. Apart from a minimal sitagliptin-induced increase in intraduodenal fluid secretion, pancreatic exocrine function was unaffected.

We conducted exposure-response analyses to provide important information on individual responses to given drug doses, reflecting inter-individual variations in drug metabolism, absorption and excretion. Methods: We report efficacy and safety responses across a wide range of exposure levels, using data from one phase II (liraglutide doses 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0mg), and two phase IIIa [SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes (3.0mg); SCALE Diabetes (1.8; 3.0mg)] randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n=4372). Results: There was a clear exposure-weight loss response. Weight loss increased with greater exposure and appeared to level off at the highest exposures associated with liraglutide 3.0mg in most individuals, but did not fully plateau in men. In individuals with overweight/obesity and comorbid type 2 diabetes, there was a clear exposure-glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) relationship. HbA1c reduction increased with higher plasma liraglutide concentration (plateauing at ∼21nM); however, for individuals with baseline HbA1c >8.5%, HbA1c reduction did not fully plateau. No exposure-response relationship was identified for any safety outcome, with the exception of gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). Individuals with gallbladder AEs, acute pancreatitis or malignant/breast/benign colorectal neoplasms did not have higher liraglutide exposure compared with the overall population. Conclusions: These analyses support the use of liraglutide 3.0mg for weight management in all subgroups investigated; weight loss increased with higher drug exposure, with no concomitant deterioration in safety/tolerability besides previously known gastrointestinal side effects. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Body weight; Glucagon-like peptide-1; Incretin; Pharmacokinetic","Appetite Depressants; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Combined Modality Therapy; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diet, Reducing; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Exercise; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Prediabetic State; Sex Characteristics; Weight Loss; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; placebo; anorexigenic agent; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; incretin; liraglutide; acute pancreatitis; adult; Article; colorectal tumor; comorbidity; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug absorption; drug excretion; drug exposure; drug metabolism; drug tolerability; female; gallbladder disease; gastrointestinal disease; gender; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; outcome assessment; phase 2 clinical trial; phase 3 clinical trial; treatment duration; treatment response; weight reduction; adverse effects; agonists; blood; body mass; clinical trial; cohort analysis; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; dose response; drug effects; exercise; low calory diet; metabolism; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; obesity; Overweight; Prediabetic State; randomized controlled trial; sexual development; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959306628"

Liraglutide's weight loss efficacy was also examined.Subjects/Methods: In this randomized, double-blind trial, non-diabetic participants with obesity who had moderate (AHI 15-29.9 events h -1) or severe (AHI ≥30 events h -1) OSA and were unwilling/unable to use continuous positive airway pressure therapy were randomized for 32 weeks to liraglutide 3.0 mg (n=180) or placebo (n=179), both as adjunct to diet (500 kcal day -1 deficit) and exercise. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (mean age 48.5 years, males 71.9%, AHI 49.2 events h -1, severe OSA 67.1%, body weight 117.6 kg, body mass index 39.1 kg m -2, prediabetes 63.2%, HbA 1c 5.7%). Results: After 32 weeks, the mean reduction in AHI was greater with liraglutide than with placebo (-12.2 vs -6.1 events h -1, estimated treatment difference: -6.1 events h -1 (95% confidence interval (CI), -11.0 to -1.2), P=0.0150). Liraglutide produced greater mean percentage weight loss compared with placebo (-5.7% vs -1.6%, estimated treatment difference: -4.2% (95% CI, -5.2 to -3.1%), P<0.0001). A statistically significant association between the degree of weight loss and improvement in OSA end points (P<0.01, all) was demonstrated post hoc. Greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were seen with liraglutide versus placebo (both P<0.001). The safety profile of liraglutide 3.0 mg was similar to that seen with doses ≤1.8 mg. Conclusions: As an adjunct to diet and exercise, liraglutide 3.0 mg was generally well tolerated and produced significantly greater reductions than placebo in AHI, body weight, SBP and HbA 1c in participants with obesity and moderate/severe OSA. The results confirm that weight loss improves OSA-related parameters. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.","","Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Obesity Agents; Double-Blind Method; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Polysomnography; Prospective Studies; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Treatment Outcome; United States; Weight Loss; Young Adult; amylase; calcitonin; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; placebo; triacylglycerol lipase; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; liraglutide; adjuvant therapy; adult; angina pectoris; apnea hypopnea index; arthralgia; Article; body mass; bone lesion; cholecystitis; cholelithiasis; constipation; controlled study; dehydration; depression; diarrhea; diet therapy; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug fatality; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; dyspepsia; exercise; female; gastroesophageal reflux; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; heart infarction; human; impaired glucose tolerance; influenza; injection site hematoma; injection site reaction; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; mouth disease; nausea; nightmare; obesity; oropharyngeal swelling; pancreatitis; patient compliance; pharynx disease; pneumonia; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; prostate cancer; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; side effect; sinus arrest; sleep; sleep disordered breathing; spine fracture; stomach obstruction; suicidal behavior; systolic blood pressure; thyroid medullary carcinoma; treatment duration; unstable angina pectoris; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; weight reduction; adolescent; body weight loss; complication; drug effects; epidemiology; metabolism; middle aged; obesity; pathophysiology; polysomnography; prospective study; sleep disordered breathing; treatment outcome; United States; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964253158"

The United States (U.S.) has arguably led the world in the percentage of overweight and/or obese per capita for several decades. As a result, numerous FDA-approved pharmacotherapeutic options are available for the long-term treatment of obesity. Although most of these medications have been on the U.S. market for a few years and have demonstrated efficacy for long-term weight loss in clinical trials, the impact of these medications on obesity in the U.S. has yet to be realized. Areas covered: We will review and evaluate why pharmacotherapy for obesity has not produced a meaningful reduction in the number of overweight and obese adults in the U.S. Expert commentary: Several obstacles, such as adverse drug effects, poor insurance coverage, not treating obesity as a chronic disease, and availability of other weight loss alternatives, has resulted in poor performance of pharmacotherapy for obesity in the U.S. market. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Belviq; Contrave; liraglutide; lorcaserin; naltrexone/bupropion; Orlistat; phentermine/topiramate; Qsymia; Saxenda","amfebutamone plus naltrexone; antiobesity agent; fenfluramine plus phentermine; liraglutide; lorcaserin; phentermine; phentermine plus topiramate; placebo; sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; unclassified drug; abdominal pain; adult; Article; bariatric surgery; cardiovascular disease; constipation; defecation urgency; dehydration; depressed blood pressure; dietary supplement; dizziness; drug dose comparison; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug quality; drug safety; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; fatigue; fibromyalgia; gastric banding; gastric bypass surgery; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; heart murmur; heart rate; human; insomnia; kidney disease; lifestyle modification; liver injury; liver toxicity; low calory diet; low drug dose; lung edema; migraine; nausea; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pancreatitis; patient compliance; pulmonary hypertension; recommended drug dose; side effect; steatorrhea; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; surgical mortality; tobacco dependence; United States; upper abdominal pain; valvular heart disease; vomiting; xerostomia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987621962"

Objective: To investigate the role of GLP-1 RAs on bone formation and weight loss-induced bone mass reduction. Design: Randomized control study. Setting: Outpatient research hospital clinic. Participants: Thirty-seven healthy obese women with body mass index of 34 ± 0.5 kg/m2 and age 46 ± 2 years. Intervention: After a low-calorie-diet-induced 12% weight loss, participants were randomized to treatment with or without administration of the GLP-1 RA liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) for 52 weeks. In case of weight gain, up to two meals per day could be replaced with a low-calorie-diet product to maintain the weight loss. Main Outcome Measures: Total, pelvic, and arm-leg bone mineral content (BMC) and bone markers [C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-1) and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP)] were investigated before and after weight loss and after 52-week weight maintenance. Primary endpoints were changes in BMC and bone markers after 52-week weight maintenance with or without GLP-1 RA treatment. Results: Total, pelvic, and arm-leg BMC decreased during weight maintenance in the control group (P < .0001), but not significantly in the liraglutide group. Thus, total and arm-leg BMC loss was four times greater in the control group compared to the liraglutide group (estimated difference, 27 g; 95% confidence interval, 5-48; P = .01), although the 12% weight loss was maintained in both groups. In the liraglutide group, the bone formation marker P1NP increased by 16% (7 ± 3 μg/L) vsa2%(-1 ± 4 μg/L) decrease in the control group (P < .05). The bone resorption marker CTX-1 collagen did not change during the weight loss maintenance phase. Conclusions: Treatment with a long-acting GLP-1 RA increased bone formation by 16% and prevented bone loss after weight loss obtained through a low-calorie diet, supporting its role as a safe weight-lowering agent.

GLP-1R agonists also decelerate gastric emptying, reduce body weight by reduction of food intake and lower circulating lipoproteins, inflammation, and systolic blood pressure. Preclinical studies demonstrate that both GLP-1R agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors exhibit cardioprotective actions in animal models of myocardial ischemia and ventricular dysfunction through incompletely characterized mechanisms. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials in human subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and increased cardiovascular risk have demonstrated a cardiovascular benefit (significant reduction in time to first major adverse cardiovascular event) with the GLP-1R agonists liraglutide (LEADER trial [Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Ourcome Results], ?13%) and semaglutide (SUSTAIN-6 trial [Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide], ?24%). In contrast, cardiovascular outcome trials examining the safety of the shorter-acting GLP-1R agonist lixisenatide (ELIXA trial [Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrom]) and the DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin (SAVORTIMI 53 trial [Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53]), alogliptin (EXAMINE trial [Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes With Alogliptin Versus Standard of Care in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Acute Coronary Syndrome]), and sitagliptin (TECOS [Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes With Sitagliptin]) found that these agents neither increased nor decreased cardiovascular events. Here we review the cardiovascular actions of GLP-1R agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, with a focus on the translation of mechanisms derived from preclinical studies to complementary findings in clinical studies. We highlight areas of uncertainty requiring more careful scrutiny in ongoing basic science and clinical studies. As newer more potent GLP-1R agonists and coagonists are being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the delineation of the potential mechanisms that underlie the cardiovascular benefit and safety of these agents have immediate relevance for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.","Acute myocardial infarction; Cardiovascular events; Cardiovascular outcomes trials; Congestive heart failure; DPP-4Is; GLP-1; GLP-1R agonists; Incretin; Stroke","Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Myocardial Ischemia; Risk Factors; Ventricular Dysfunction; amide; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; incretin; liraglutide; semaglutide; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; amino terminal sequence; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular effect; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular parameters; cardiovascular risk; cardiovascular tissue; clinical outcome; drug mechanism; drug metabolism; endothelium; heart infarction; heart output; heart rate; human; inflammation; ischemic conditioning; kidney function; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; patient safety; priority journal; prophylaxis; steatosis; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombosis; agonists; animal; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; heart ventricle function; metabolism; Myocardial Ischemia; risk factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029679644"

Methods: Using pooled data from the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes and SCALE Diabetes trials, weight loss of ≥4% at 16 weeks best predicted ≥5% weight loss after 56 weeks. Weight loss and changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and health-related quality of life were evaluated in ERs (≥4% weight loss at week 16) and ENRs (<4% weight loss at week 16) completing 56 weeks’ treatment. Results: Proportions of ERs/ENRs to liraglutide 3.0 mg were 77.3%/22.7% (individuals without type 2 diabetes, T2D) and 62.7%/37.3% (those with T2D). Greater mean weight loss was observed in ERs versus ENRs: 10.8% versus 3.0% (without T2D) and 8.5% versus 3.1% (T2D). In both trials, greater proportions of ERs versus ENRs achieved ≥5%, >10%, and >15% weight loss at week 56 with liraglutide 3.0 mg. Greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and health-related quality of life scores were observed in ERs versus ENRs.

Liraglutide is presently used in the treatment of selected patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Objective: To assess efficacy and safety of liraglutide in, overweight and obese Indian patients with T2DM. Methods: A single center, prospective, open-labeled, single-arm, observational study for 24 weeks in a real-world setting. Fourteen overweight and obese patients with T2DM who were clinically suitable for liraglutide therapy received liraglutide injections. The starting dose of liraglutide (Victoza) injection was 0.6 mg/day for 3 days followed by 1.2 mg for next 10 days and finally 1.8 mg/day for 22 weeks. Patients were evaluated at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of therapy. Adverse events (AE) noted during course of therapy were recorded. A repeated measure analysis of variance was performed to assess statistical significance. Results: Fourteen patients were studied for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks of liraglutide therapy, mean fasting and postprandial plasma glucose decreased by 48.5 mg/dL and 66.71 mg/dL, respectively (P = 0.002 and P = 0004 over 24 weeks, respectively). A mean reduction of 2.26% of glycosylated hemoglobin was noted (P < 0.001 over 24 weeks). Mean decrease in body weight of 8.65 kg and mean decrease in body mass index of 3.26 kg/m2 was noted (P < 0.001 over 24 weeks for each parameter). Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 15.15 mm of Hg (P = 0.004). Significant improvement in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and serum creatinine was noted. Nine patients reported AEs. The AEs noticed were nausea (n = 6), feeling of satiety (n = 3), and vomiting (n = 1). No serious AE or hypoglycemic episodes were observed. Conclusion: Liraglutide once a day improved overall glycemic control and was well tolerated. Clinically significant reduction in body weight, systolic blood pressure and improvement in lipid profile were noticed with liraglutide therapy in addition to glycemic control. © 2012 Kesavadev et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.","Blood pressure; GLP-1 analog; India; Lipid profile; Liraglutide; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes; Weight loss","cholesterol; creatinine; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; adult; article; body mass; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; creatinine blood level; diet restriction; dose response; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; female; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; Indian; kidney function test; lipid analysis; male; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; prospective study; satiety; side effect; systolic blood pressure; vomiting; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867687757"

The mechanism by which GLP-1 receptor agonists induce weight loss is believed to be related to multiple actions involving the brain and gastrointestinal tract, with the primary action related to an increase in satiety. Trials examining the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss have compared exenatide, liraglutide, and orlistat. Of the studies completed to date, the majority of patients have been enrolled in trials involving liraglutide. Based on the reviewed literature, both exenatide 10 μg twice daily and liraglutide in dosages of up to 3 mg daily resulted in significant weight loss in patients without diabetes. A decrease in the proportion of patients with prediabetes was also found in studies of liraglutide. Nausea and vomiting were the most frequently reported adverse events in patients from these studies. Symptomatic hypoglycemia was reported in only one study with liraglutide in patients without diabetes and was not objectively confirmed by laboratory data. A higher frequency of psychiatric disorders, specifically insomnia, was reported by patients taking high doses of liraglutide. Conclusion. GLP-1 receptor agonists offer a reasonable alternative for nondiabetic patients not able to achieve weight-loss goals with lifestyle modifications alone.

Thus, a very important goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is to reduce the risk of macrovascular complications and mortality. Hyperglycaemia, obesity and hypertension are well-known risk factors for vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a common co-morbidity and an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension is a condition associated with diabetes that increases the risk of cardiovascular complications and death. It has been demonstrated that decrease and control in blood pressure reduces the risk of macrovascular complications. Patients with type 2 diabetes have a decreased β-cell function, which is one of the reasons for disease progression. Current medications are able to improve glycaemic control, but they do not reverse the disease progression and often result in weight gain. Hence, new treatment approaches are needed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The role of the native glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) biology has generated new hope for the successful management of type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide is the first once-daily human GLP-1 analogue, which has been developed to address the unmet medical needs in the management of type 2 diabetes. This novel drug may offer additional advantages over other current antidiabetic medications. Clinical trials demonstrate that liraglutide reduces weight, lowers blood pressure and restores β-cell function, besides improving glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The results also show that liraglutide is well tolerated with minimal risk of hypoglycaemia due to its glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion. The overall clinical findings indicate that liraglutide is a treatment for type 2 diabetes, which improves β-cell function, and reduces the burden of type 2 diabetes and its vascular complications. © SUPPLEMENT TO JAPI.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955812437"

Hypoglycaemia and weight gain are the common side effects of insulin treatment and may reduce compliance. In patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, the addition of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) therapy has proven effective in reducing weight gain and insulin dose. The present publication describes a protocol for a study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adding a GLP-1RA to insulin treatment in overweight patients with T1D in a randomised, double-blinded, controlled design. Methods and analysis: In total, 100 patients with type 1 diabetes, poor glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) >8%) and overweight (body mass index >25 kg/m2) will be randomised to either liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily or placebo as an add-on to intensive insulin therapy in this investigator initiated, double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel study. The primary end point is glycaemic control as measured by changes in HbA1c. Secondary end points include changes in the insulin dose, hypoglyacemic events, body weight, lean body mass, fat mass, food preferences and adverse events. Glycaemic excursions, postprandial glucagon levels and gastric emptying rate during a standardised liquid meal test will also be studied. Ethics and dissemination: The study is approved by the Danish Medicines Authority, the Regional Scientific-Ethical Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark and the Data Protection Agency.

Some preclinical studies have suggested that chronic activation of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) signalling in the pancreas may result in the proliferation of islet β-cells and an increase in β-cell mass. This provided hope that enhancing GLP1 action could potentially alter the natural progression of type 2 diabetes. However, to date, there has been no evidence from clinical trials suggesting that GLP1R agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors can increase β-cell mass. Nevertheless, while the proliferative capacity of these agents remains controversial, some studies have raised concerns that they could potentially contribute to the development of pancreatitis and hence increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. Currently, there are very limited clinical data to directly assess these potential benefits and risks of incretin-based therapies. However, a review of the preclinical studies indicates that incretin-based therapies probably have only a limited capacity to regenerate pancreatic β-cells, but may be useful for preserving any remaining β-cells in type 2 diabetes. In addition, the majority of preclinical evidence does not support the notion that GLP1R agonists or DPP4 inhibitors cause pancreatitis. © 2014 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.","β-cells; DPP4; GLP1; Islets; Mice; Pancreatitis; Rats","Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Pancreas; DPP4; GLP1; islets; mice; pancreatitis; rats; β-cells; 6 [[2 [[2 (2 cyano 1 pyrrolidinyl) 2 oxoethyl]amino]ethyl]amino]nicotinonitrile; broxuridine; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; incretin; insulin; Ki 67 antigen; liraglutide; sitagliptin; vildagliptin; apoptosis; article; cell proliferation; experimental pancreatitis; food intake; gene expression; glucose blood level; Goto Kakizaki rat; human; hyperglycemia; insulin resistance; lipid diet; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas resection; pancreatitis; priority journal; Sprague Dawley rat; transgenic mouse; weight reduction; Zucker diabetic fatty rat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897823030"

Despite this, there are no universally accepted pharmacological therapies for NASH. Liraglutide (Victoza), a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has been shown to improve weight loss, glycaemic control and liver enzymes in type 2 diabetes. There is currently a lack of prospective-controlled studies investigating the efficacy of GLP-1 analogues in patients with NASH. Methods and analysis: Liraglutide efficacy and action in NASH (LEAN) is a phase II, multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial designed to investigate whether a 48-week treatment with 1.8 mg liraglutide will result in improvements in liver histology in patients with NASH. Adult, overweight (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2) patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH were assessed for eligibility at five recruitment centres in the UK. Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of either 1.8 mg liraglutide or liraglutide-placebo (control). Using A'Hern's single stage phase II methodology (significance level 0.05; power 0.90) and accounting for an estimated 20% withdrawal rate, a minimum of 25 patients were randomised to each treatment group. The primary outcome measure will be centrally assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis of the proportion of evaluable patients achieving an improvement in liver histology between liver biopsies at baseline and after 48 weeks of treatment. Histological improvement will be defined as a combination of the disappearance of active NASH and no worsening in fibrosis. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (East Midlands-Northampton committee; 10/H0402/32) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Recruitment into the LEAN started in August 2010 and ended in May 2013, with 52 patients randomised. The treatment follow-up of LEAN participants is currently ongoing and is due to finish in July 2014. The findings of this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and international presentations.

Here, evolving strategies for developing antiobesity therapies, including targets, mechanisms, and developmental status, are highlighted. Progress in this field is underscored by Belviq (lorcaserin) and Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate), the first agents in more than 10 years to achieve regulatory approval for chronic weight management in obese patients. On the horizon, novel insights into metabolism and energy homeostasis reveal guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) signaling circuits as emerging targets for antiobesity pharmacotherapy. These innovations in molecular discovery may elegantly align with practical off-the-shelf approaches, leveraging existing approved drugs that modulate cGMP levels for the management of obesity.","","amfebutamone; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; amphetamine; amphetamine derivative; antiobesity agent; appetite stimulant; cetilistat; cyclic GMP; davalintide; desvenlafaxine; exendin 4; fenfluramine; leptin; liraglutide; lorcaserin; metreleptin; osymia; oxyntomodulin; phentermine; phentermine plus topiramate; phenylpropanolamine; pramlintide; rimonabant; sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; unclassified drug; velneperit; abdominal pain; anorexia; anxiety; arthralgia; article; bradycardia; brain hemorrhage; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular effect; cerebrovascular accident; cognitive defect; constipation; depression; diarrhea; dizziness; drug approval; drug dependence; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug targeting; eating habit; energy metabolism; excitability; exercise; fatigue; fear; food and drug administration; headache; health care cost; heart infarction; heart palpitation; human; hyperhidrosis; hypertension; hypoglycemia; infection; lifestyle modification; lipid absorption; liver toxicity; mental disease; multicenter study (topic); nausea; nephrolithiasis; nephrotoxicity; nervousness; nonhuman; obesity; pancreatitis; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); pipeline; priapism; priority journal; pulmonary hypertension; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); restlessness; sexual dysfunction; signal transduction; sinusitis; steatorrhea; sudden cardiac death; sudden death; suicidal ideation; suicide; tremor; valvular heart disease; vomiting; weight reduction; withdrawal syndrome; xerostomia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890919810"

Reaching and maintaining acceptable glycemic control is more difficult in overweight and obese patients, and these conditions are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and other diseases. Glycemic management for these patients is complicated by the fact that insulin and many of the oral medications available to treat type 2 diabetes produce additional weight gain. However, an increasing number of therapeutic options are available that are weight neutral or lead to weight loss in addition to their glycemic benefits. This article evaluates the evidence from clinical trials regarding the relative glycemic benefits, measured in terms of glycated hemoglobin change, versus the impact on body weight of each medication currently approved for type 2 diabetes. In general, the sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and D-phenylalanine derivatives have been shown to promote weight gain. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are weight neutral, while the biguanides, incretin mimetics, and amylin mimetics promote weight loss. Trials examining the glycemic benefits of the weight loss agents orlistat and sibutramine are also examined. Awareness of this evidence base can be used to inform medication selection in support of weight management goals for patients with type 2 diabetes. © Postgraduate Medicine.","Glycemic control; Obesity; Overweight; Type 2 diabetes","Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Obesity; acarbose; amylin derivative; biguanide derivative; chlorpropamide; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; exendin 4; glibenclamide; glimepiride; glipizide; glitazone derivative; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; miglitol; nateglinide; oral antidiabetic agent; phenylalanine derivative; pioglitazone; placebo; pramlintide; repaglinide; rosiglitazone; saxagliptin; sibutramine; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea derivative; tetrahydrolipstatin; tolbutamide; unindexed drug; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; glycosylated hemoglobin; incretin; adjuvant therapy; article; body weight; cardiovascular disease; combination chemotherapy; continuous infusion; diarrhea; diet; dosage schedule comparison; drug dose comparison; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug dose regimen; drug dose titration; drug effect; drug mechanism; edema; exercise; flatulence; gastrointestinal disease; glycemic control; heart rate; human; hypertension; hypoglycemia; low calory diet; monotherapy; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; peripheral edema; rhinopharyngitis; side effect; urinary tract infection; weight gain; blood; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physiology; review","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953101143"

Chronic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist administration in rodents has been associated with increased serum CT levels and C-cell tumor formation. There are no longitudinal studies measuring CT in humans without medullary thyroid carcinoma or a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma and no published studies on the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on human serum CT concentrations. Aim: The aim of the study was to determine serum CT response over time to the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus or nondiabetic obese subjects. Methods: Unstimulated serum CT concentrations were measured at 3-month intervals for no more than 2 yr in a series of trials in over 5000 subjects receiving liraglutide or control therapy. Results: Basal mean CT concentrations were at the low end of normal range in all treatment groups and remained low throughout the trials. At 2 yr, estimated geometric mean values were no greater than 1.0 ng/liter, well below upper normal ranges for males and females. Proportions of subjects whose CT levels increased above a clinically relevant cutoff of 20 ng/liter were very low in all groups. There was no consistent dose or time-dependent relationship and no consistent difference between treatment groups. Conclusions: These data do not support an effect of GLP-1 receptor activation on serum CT levels in humans and suggest that findings previously reported in rodents may not apply to humans. However, the long-term consequences of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment are a subject of further studies.

Glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, and growth hormone serve as the classic glucose counterregulatory hormones. The incretins are hormones released by enteroendocrine cells in the intestine in response to a meal. Classically, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been considered to be a triad of insulin resistance, increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, and progressive β-cell exhaustion/failure. However, disordered enteroendocrine physiology, specifically the reduced activity of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is also a principal pathophysiologic abnormality of the disease. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists that have been studied include exenatide and liraglutide, which have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with T2DM. Sitagliptin and saxagliptin, both approved for use in the United States, modulate incretin physiology by inhibiting degradation of GLP-1 by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Modulators of incretin physiology have been shown to improve glycemic control with a low risk for hypoglycemia and beneficially affect β-cell function. Unlike the DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy also produces weight loss, an important consideration given the close association among T2DM, overweight/obesity, and cardiovascular disease. The GLP-1 receptor agonists have also demonstrated beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors other than hyperglycemia and excess body weight, such as lipid concentrations and blood pressure. This article describes incretin physiology and studies of pharmacologic therapy designed to address the blunted incretin response in patients with T2DM.

Despite recent therapeutic drug trials, metformin and insulin are the only medicines currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth. Because of recently amended pharmaceutical regulations, however, it is likely that more antidiabetic medications soon will be added to the armamentarium of therapeutic options for youth with type 2 diabetes.

We assessed the effect of liraglutide on bodyweight and tolerability in obese individuals without type 2 diabetes. Methods: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled 20-week trial, with open-label orlistat comparator in 19 sites in Europe. 564 individuals (18-65 years of age, body-mass index 30-40 kg/m2) were randomly assigned, with a telephone or web-based system, to one of four liraglutide doses (1·2 mg, 1·8 mg, 2·4 mg, or 3·0 mg, n=90-95) or to placebo (n=98) administered once a day subcutaneously, or orlistat (120 mg, n=95) three times a day orally. All individuals had a 500 kcal per day energy-deficit diet and increased their physical activity throughout the trial, including the 2-week run-in. Weight change analysed by intention to treat was the primary endpoint. An 84-week open-label extension followed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00422058. Findings: Participants on liraglutide lost significantly more weight than did those on placebo (p=0·003 for liraglutide 1·2 mg and p<0·0001 for liraglutide 1·8-3·0 mg) and orlistat (p=0·003 for liraglutide 2·4 mg and p<0·0001 for liraglutide 3·0 mg). Mean weight loss with liraglutide 1·2-3·0 mg was 4·8 kg, 5·5 kg, 6·3 kg, and 7·2 kg compared with 2·8 kg with placebo and 4·1 kg with orlistat, and was 2·1 kg (95% CI 0·6-3·6) to 4·4 kg (2·9-6·0) greater than that with placebo. More individuals (76%, n=70) lost more than 5% weight with liraglutide 3·0 mg that with placebo (30%, n=29) or orlistat (44%, n=42). Liraglutide reduced blood pressure at all doses, and reduced the prevalence of prediabetes (84-96% reduction) with 1·8-3·0 mg per day. Nausea and vomiting occurred more often in individuals on liraglutide than in those on placebo, but adverse events were mainly transient and rarely led to discontinuation of treatment. Interpretation: Liraglutide treatment over 20 weeks is well tolerated, induces weight loss, improves certain obesity-related risk factors, and reduces prediabetes.

Together, these metabolic disease epidemics have contributed to the increasing incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease. The accumulation of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetesrisk factors that may exacerbate one anothercomplicates treatment. Inadequate treatment, treatment that fails to achieve goals, increases the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. From a clinical perspective, type 2 diabetes is a cardiovascular disease, an observation that is supported by a range of epidemiologic, postmortem, and cardiovascular imaging studies. Vascular wall dysfunction, and particularly endothelial dysfunction, has been posited as a ""common soil"" linking dysglycemic and cardiovascular diseases. Vascular wall dysfunction promoted by environmental triggers (e.g., sedentary lifestyle) and metabolic triggers (chronic hyperglycemia, obesity) has been associated with the upregulation of reactive oxygen species and chronic inflammatory and hypercoagulable states, and as such with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. Glucagon-like peptide1 (GLP)-1, an incretin hormone, and synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonists represent promising new areas of research and therapeutics in the struggle not only against type 2 diabetes but also against the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with type 2 diabetes. In a number of small trials in humans, as well as in preclinical and in vitro studies, both native GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists have demonstrated positive effects on a range of cardiovascular disease pathologies and clinical targets, including such markers of vascular inflammation as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor1, and brain natriuretic peptide. Reductions in markers of dyslipidemia such as elevated levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids have also been observed, as have cardioprotective functions. Larger trials of longer duration will be required to confirm preliminary findings. In large human trials, GLP-1 receptor agonists have been associated with significant reductions in both blood pressure and weight. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, its efficacy and safety in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not yet been addressed. DESIGN Thirty-two obese women (aged 27.6±7.2 years, BMI 39.5±6.2 kg/m2) with newly diagnosed PCOS were randomized to receive either liraglutide 1.2 mg QD sc (n=17) or metformin 1000 mg BID po (n=15) for 12 weeks; 28 patients completed the study (14 on liraglutide and 14 on metformin). The main outcome was change in body weight. RESULTS Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant BMI (-0.98 kg/m2; p<0.001), body weight (-2.52 kg; p<0.001), waist circumference (-3.38 cm; p<0.001) and whole-body fat mass (-1.26%; p<0.001) reduction in both treatment arms without significant differences between therapeutic groups. However, in a subgroup of patients (n=9) with insulin resistance (HOMAIR >2), severe obesity and higher odds ratio for the metabolic syndrome (OR=3.9), the patients fared much better with liraglutide than with metformin (mean BMI decreased 2.13 kg/m 2 vs. 0.62 kg/m2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Short-term liraglutide treatment was associated with significant weight loss in a subset of obese patients with newly diagnosed PCOS and a higher metabolic risk profile. © 2015, Hellenic Endocrine Society.

Treatment options beyond metformin and insulin are needed. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide once daily in youth (10-17 years old) with T2D were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.; Subjects and Methods: Youth treated with diet/exercise alone or with metformin and having a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 6.5-11% were randomized to liraglutide (n=14) or placebo (n=7). Starting at 0.3mg/day, doses were escalated weekly to 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.8mg/day (or placebo equivalent) for 5 weeks.; Results: Nineteen participants completed the trial. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, with mean (SD) values for age of 14.8 (2.2) years, weight of 113.2 (35.6) kg (range, 57-214kg), diabetes duration of 1.7 (1.4) years, and HbA1c level of 8.1% (1.2%). No serious adverse events (AEs), including severe hypoglycemia, occurred. Transient gastrointestinal AEs were most common at lower liraglutide doses during dose escalation. No significant changes in safety and tolerability parameters occurred. There was no evidence of pancreatitis or lipase elevations above three times the upper normal limit; calcitonin levels remained within the normal range. For liraglutide 1.8mg, mean half-life was 12h, and clearance was 1.7L/h. After 5 weeks, the decline in HbA1c level was greater with liraglutide versus placebo (-0.86 vs. 0.04%, P=0.0007), whereas mean body weight remained stable (-0.50 vs. -0.54kg, P=0.9703).; Conclusions: Liraglutide was well tolerated in youth with T2D, with safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles similar to profiles in adults. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.","","Adolescent; Age of Onset; Belgium; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Great Britain; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Pediatric Obesity; Prevalence; Slovenia; Treatment Outcome; United States; Weight Loss; amylase; calcitonin; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; metformin; placebo; triacylglycerol lipase; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; liraglutide; abdominal pain; adolescent; amylase blood level; Article; body mass; body weight; calcitonin blood level; child; childhood disease; clinical article; controlled study; diarrhea; diet therapy; disease duration; double blind procedure; drug clearance; drug dose escalation; drug half life; drug safety; drug tolerability; female; follow up; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypoglycemia; kinesiotherapy; male; maximum plasma concentration; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; randomized controlled trial; treatment duration; triacylglycerol lipase blood level; vomiting; analogs and derivatives; Belgium; blood; clinical trial; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; dose response; drug effects; metabolism; multicenter study; onset age; Pediatric Obesity; prevalence; Slovenia; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; United States; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907519425"

This unimolecular dual incretin is derived from an intermixed sequence of GLP-1 and GIP, and demonstrated enhanced antihyperglycemic and insulinotropic efficacy relative to selective GLP-1 agonists. Notably, this superior efficacy translated across rodent models of obesity and diabetes, including db/db mice and ZDF rats, to primates (cynomolgus monkeys and humans). Furthermore, this co-agonist exhibited synergism in reducing fat mass in obese rodents, whereas a selective GIP agonist demonstrated negligible weight-lowering efficacy. The unimolecular dual incretins corrected two causal mechanisms of diabesity, adiposity-induced insulin resistance and pancreatic insulin deficiency, more effectively than did selective mono-agonists. The duration of action of the unimolecular dual incretins was refined through site-specific lipidation or PEGylation to support less frequent administration. These peptides provide comparable pharmacology to the native peptides and enhanced efficacy relative to similarly modified selective GLP-1 agonists. The pharmacokinetic enhancement lessened peak drug exposure and, in combination with less dependence on GLP-1-mediated pharmacology, avoided the adverse gastrointestinal effects that typify selective GLP-1-based agonists. This discovery and validation of a balanced and high-potency dual incretin agonist enables a more physiological approach to management of diseases associated with impaired glucose tolerance.","","Acylation; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucose Tolerance Test; Haplorhini; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Incretins; Insulin; Male; Mice; Middle Aged; Peptides; Rats; Receptors, Gastrointestinal Hormone; Receptors, Glucagon; Rodentia; Treatment Outcome; Venoms; Weight Loss; Young Adult; C peptide; cholesterol; exendin 4; fatty acid; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucagon receptor; glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor; hemoglobin A1c; hormone receptor; incretin; insulin; ketone; liraglutide; macrogol; paracetamol; placebo; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; unimolecular dual incretin; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; area under the curve; article; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diarrhea; dosage schedule comparison; drug blood level; drug dose comparison; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; drug safety; drug synthesis; dyslipidemia; energy balance; experimental diabetes mellitus; experimental obesity; fat mass; female; food intake; gastrointestinal symptom; glucose tolerance; glycemic control; human; human experiment; hyperglycemia; insulin blood level; insulin like activity; insulin release; insulin resistance; Macaca fascicularis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouse; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; normal human; pharmacodynamics; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rat; single blind procedure; stomach emptying; vomiting; weight reduction; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890043525"

The burgeoning population of DM2 has been attributed to parallel increases in obesity, sedentary lifestyle and less healthy dietary component choices (e.g., high glycemic index foods). By the time DM2 is diagnosed, at least 50% of ?-cell function has been lost; this loss appears to progress inexorably, despite treatment. Because control of glucose has been shown to reduce diabetic microvascular complications, and improve quality of life, tools that enhance this process are valuable to clinicians and patients alike. We have evolved in our understanding of DM2 to recognize that multiple metabolic defects contribute to this disorder. Accordingly, it is uncommon that any monotherapy can consistently provide durable control of DM2. Pharmacotherapies that address the multiple metabolic derangements now identified in DM2, especially amongst the incretin class, may also be helpful as they have often been found to be more 'user friendly' because they result in less weight gain, less hypoglycemia, and have the utility to be particularly useful for addressing postprandial glucose excursions. Our discussion will focus upon vildagliptin, an oral dipeptidyl peptidase type 4 inhibitor, one of the earliest oral incretin enhancers to be trialed in clinical use, and will be restricted to DM2, rather than Type 1 diabetes in which no role for noninsulin therapies has been clearly defined. Salutary metabolic effects of glucagon like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide or gastric inhibitory peptide have been difficult to capture, since their half-life is very brief (12 min). For GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide, the enzyme responsible for degradation is DPP-4; hence, DPP-4 inhibitors delay GLP-1 degradation, prolonging the therapeutic effect. The two currently available novel therapeutic approaches to capture incretin effects are DPP-4 inhibition, and parenteral GLP-1 agonism (i.e., exenatide, liraglutide). As DM2 can uncommonly be controlled with monotherapy, it is important to evaluate add-on treatments. In a meta-analysis of 27 randomized controlled trials (mean duration 32 weeks) addressing DM2 inadequately controlled with metformin, comparable degrees of improved glucose control were achieved with various pharmacotherapeutic classes including α-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, glinides, GLP-1 agonists, sulfonylurea and thiazolidinediones (TZD). Incretins and α-glucosidase inhibitors were associated with weight neutrality; as has been consistently noted in multiple trials, sulfonylurea and thiazolidinedione had a significant incidence of weight gain; hypoglycemia was more frequent with sulfonylurea. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.","Dipeptidyl peptidase type 4 inhibitor; Gastric inhibitory peptide; Glucagon-like peptide 1; Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; Incretins; Type 2 diabetes; Vildagliptin","acarbose; alogliptin; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; exendin 4; glibenclamide; glimepiride; glitazone derivative; glucagon; glucose; incretin; insulin; linagliptin; lipid; liraglutide; metformin; pioglitazone; placebo; rosiglitazone; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea derivative; vildagliptin; warfarin; acute pancreatitis; add on therapy; alanine aminotransferase blood level; angioneurotic edema; area under the curve; arthralgia; article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; asthenia; blister; bronchitis; combination chemotherapy; constipation; diabetes mellitus; dizziness; dosage schedule comparison; dose kidney function relation; dose liver function relation; dose time effect relation; drug absorption; drug antagonism; drug half life; drug induced headache; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug metabolism; drug withdrawal; enzyme inhibition; fatigue; food; food drug interaction; gastrointestinal symptom; geriatric patient; glucagon release; glucose metabolism; heart disease; hormone action; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hyperglycemia; hypertransaminasemia; hypoglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; infection; influenza; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; lactation; lipid metabolism; liver dysfunction; lymphocyte count; maximum plasma concentration; monotherapy; nausea; neurologic disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas islet alpha cell; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet cell function; peripheral edema; pregnancy; reproductive toxicity; rhinopharyngitis; side effect; single drug dose; skin defect; skin disease; skin exfoliation; skin ulcer; thyroid disease; tremor; unspecified side effect; upper respiratory tract infection; weight gain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-81255199065"

The initial goal of obesity management is usually a 5% to 10% weight reduction. Some people will sustain weight loss with changes in diet and exercise alone; however, these patients represent the minority, and a large percentage are unable to maintain weight loss over time. Patients and providers often wish to intensify obesity treatment, and therefore interest in new medications has been considerable. Until recently, only two antiobesity medications have received Food and Drug Administration approval for long-term use. In June and July of 2012, respectively, lorcaserin and combination phentermine/topiramate extended-release were approved for obesity therapy. The first section of this article reviews mechanisms, clinical trials, benefits and risks of available medications for treating obesity. Bariatric surgery is the next step for patients with a body mass index of 40 kg/m2 or 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities, based on National Institutes of Health Clinical Guidelines. These procedures and their risks and benefits are reviewed in the second section.

Preclinical data suggest that incretin-based therapies may also preserve β-cell function, holding promise of a truly disease-modifying therapy. This article examines clinical trial data and accepted algorithms with a view toward elucidating the application of these agents in routine clinical practice. We propose a systematic approach to treatment, addressing (1) patient selection, (2) optimal treatment combinations, and (3) timing and guidance for both initiation and intensification of therapy. The GLP-1 receptor agonists, for example, could be particularly beneficial in patients whose weight significantly increases cardiovascular risk. Early use of these agents may be effective in preventing diabetes in those at risk, or in halting or retarding disease progression in patients with frank diabetes. Additional clinical investigation will be required to test such hypotheses. Given the ever-increasing incidence of diabetes worldwide, the link between obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, and the need for more effective, weight-focused, convenient and sustainable treatments, the data from such studies will be invaluable to further clarify the role of the incretins in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Research design and methods- In this 26-week, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group trial, 1,091 subjects were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1:2) to once-daily liraglutide (either 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg/day injected subcutane-ously), to placebo, or to glimepiride (4 mg once daily). All treatments were in combination therapy with metformin (1g twice daily). Enrolled subjects (aged 25-79 years) had type 2 diabetes, A1C of 7-11% (previous OAD monotherapy for ≥3 months) or 7-10% (previous OAD combination therapy for ≥3 months), and BMI ≤40 kg/m2. Results- A1C values were significantly reduced in all liraglutide groups versus the placebo group (P < 0.0001) with mean decreases of 1.0% for 1.8 mg liraglutide, 1.2 mg liraglutide, and glimepiride and 0.7% for 0.6 mg liraglutide and an increase of 0.1% for placebo. Body weight decreased in all liraglutide groups (1.8-2.8 kg) compared with an increase in the glimepiride group (1.0 kg; P < 0.0001). The incidence of minor hypoglycemia with liraglutide (̃3%) was comparable to that with placebo but less than that with glimepiride (17%; P < 0.001). Nausea was reported by 11-19% of the liraglutide-treated subjects versus 3-4% in the placebo and glimepiride groups. The incidence of nausea declined over time.

Several epidemiological studies have shown a high prevalence of cardiovascular complications and mortality in obesity and metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes or hypertension. For at ""risk populations"" predisposed to target organ damage, stringent targets for blood pressure control, dyslipidaemia, and glycaemia have been set in clinical guidelines, however clinical trial and real-life evidence suggest that these targets are difficult to achieve and sustain. The first line of treatment for hypertension, metabolic syndrome and diabetes associated with obesity is weight loss with lifestyle modification, such as a low caloric diet and exercise. An alternative for those with higher BMI or comorbidities is bariatric surgery. Perhaps the most important, difficult aspect in controlling obesity, however, is avoiding weight regain. Recently, anti-obesity drugs (Orlistat, Sibutramine, and Rimonabant) have been developed to help a weight loss program and also for maintenance of weight loss, but the precise effects on blood pressure and neurohormonal parameters have not been fully clarified and side effects, particularly with rimonabant and sibutramine, have led to their use being curtailed. The purpose of this article is to discuss the current findings on pharmacological anti-obesity pharmacological treatments. ©2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Hypertension; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Obesity-related hypertension; Orlistat; Phentermine; Pramlintide; Rimonabant; Sibutramine","amfebutamone; amfepramone; dexfenfluramine; fenfluramine; fenproporex; fluoxetine; liraglutide; lorcaserin; mazindol; naltrexone; peptide YY [3-36]; phentermine; phenylpropanolamine; pramlintide; rimonabant; sertraline; sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; topiramate; zonisamide; article; bariatric surgery; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; central nervous system depression; chronic kidney disease; clinical trial; constipation; diabetes mellitus; dizziness; drug efficacy; dyslipidemia; exercise; fatigue; headache; human; hypertension; lifestyle modification; low calory diet; metabolic syndrome X; nervousness; obesity; pulse rate; seizure; side effect; tremor; unspecified side effect; weight reduction; xerostomia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649661849"

Aims of treatment include minimising long-term complications (e.g. cardiovascular disease, blindness, chronic kidney disease, premature mortality) and avoiding unwanted effects of treatment (e.g. severe hypoglycaemia, weight gain). Publication of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) 33 study in 1998 suggested that 'intensive blood glucose control' to lower the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with type 2 diabetes reduced microvascular disease but not macrovascular complications. The UKPDS 34 study in overweight patients found that metformin produced less of a reduction in HbA1c but reduced cardiovascular complications and death. More recently, further trials have examined the impact of intensive glycaemic control and have produced conflicting results. Here we examine the evidence and guideline recommendations for HbA1c targets; glycaemic control for acutely unwell patients and targets in pregnancy will not be covered.","","Biological Markers; Blood Glucose; Clinical Trials as Topic; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Evidence-Based Medicine; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Metformin; Patient Education as Topic; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Review Literature as Topic; chlorpropamide; exendin 4; glibenclamide; gliclazide; glipizide; glucose; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; insulin derivative; liraglutide; long acting insulin; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; repaglinide; rosiglitazone; sitagliptin; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; metformin; article; body weight; carbohydrate diet; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; comorbidity; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic retinopathy; disease surveillance; glucose blood level; glycemic control; heart infarction; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypoglycemia; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; ischemic heart disease; life expectancy; lifestyle modification; medical care; meta analysis (topic); non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; patient care; patient education; practice guideline; randomized controlled trial (topic); retinopathy; risk reduction; self care; social psychology; systematic review (topic); treatment duration; treatment response; wellbeing; blood; clinical trial (topic); evidence based medicine; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; literature; metabolism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876700271"

This study examined the efficacy and safety of liraglutide monotherapy compared with metformin monotherapy in overweight/obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The study was a 24-week, open-labeled, randomized controlled study. Overweight or obese patients with T2DM aged 20-75 years with suboptimal glycemic control were randomized to liraglutide or metformin monotherapy. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c at week 24. Secondary endpoints included changes in daily glycemic profile, body weight, incidence of hypoglycemia and other adverse events. The study, which was originally planned to enroll 50 subjects in each group, was ended with insufficient recruitment. A total of 46 subjects completed the study, and analysis was conducted in this cohort. Reduction in HbA1c at week 24 was comparable between the metformin (n = 24) and liraglutide (n = 22) groups (-0.95 ± 0.80% vs. -0.80 ± 0.88%, p = 0.77), while the liraglutide group reached maximal reduction more rapidly than did the metformin group. There was no significant difference in weight gain or incidence of hypoglycemia between the groups. Diarrhea was more frequent in the metformin group, while constipation was more frequent in the liraglutide group. There was no significant difference in treatment satisfaction between the groups. In conclusion, liraglutide and metformin monotherapy showed similar reduction in HbA1c during 24 weeks, with no difference in weight gain or incidence of hypoglycemia in overweight or obese Japanese patients with T2DM. ©The Japan Endocrine Society.","Japanese; Liraglutide; Metformin; Randomized controlled trial; Type 2 diabetes","Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Japan; Liraglutide; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Weight Gain; 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine; glucagon; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; proinsulin; antidiabetic agent; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; liraglutide; metformin; abdominal pain; adult; Article; clinical article; constipation; controlled study; diarrhea; drug dose increase; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; gastrointestinal symptom; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; indigestion; insulin resistance; Japanese (people); male; monotherapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; open study; pancreatitis; patient satisfaction; randomized controlled trial; waist circumference; weight change; aged; analysis; blood; chemically induced; comparative study; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; glucose blood level; hypoglycemia; Japan; middle aged; obesity; weight gain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84933509367"

In this study, we investigated the potential add-on effect of treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide on weight loss in obese nondiabetic women with PCOS who had lost <5% body weight during pretreatment with metformin. Methods: A total of 40 obese women with PCOS, who had been pretreated with metformin for at least 6 months, participated in a 12-week open-label, prospective study. They were randomized to one of three treatment arms: metformin (MET) arm 1000 mg BID, liraglutide (LIRA) arm 1.2 mg QD s.c., or combined MET 1000 mg BID and LIRA (COMBI) 1.2 mg QD s.c. Lifestyle intervention was not actively promoted. The primary outcome was change in body weight. Results: Thirty six patients (aged 31.3±7.1 years, BMI 37.1±4.6 kg/m2) completed the study: 14 on MET, 11 on LIRA, and 11 on combined treatment. COMBI therapy was superior to LIRA and MET monotherapy in reducing weight, BMI, and waist circumference. Subjects treated with COMBI lost on average 6.5±2.8 kg compared with a 3.8±3.7 kg loss in the LIRA group and a 1.2±1.4 kg loss in the MET group (P<0.001). The extent of weight loss was stratified: a total of 38% of subjects were high responders who lost ≥5% body weight, 22% of them in the COMBI arm compared with 16 and 0% in the LIRA and MET arm respectively. BMI decreased by 2.4±1.0 in the COMBI arm compared with 1.3±1.3 in LIRA and 0.5±0.5 in the MET arm (P<0.001). Waist circumference also decreased by 5.5±3.8 cm in the COMBI arm compared with 3.2±2.9 cm in LIRA and 1.6±2.9 cm in the MET arm (P=0.029). Subjects treated with liraglutide experienced more nausea than those treated with metformin, but severity of nausea decreased over time and did not correlate with weight loss. Conclusions: Short-term combined treatment with liraglutide and metformin was associated with significant weight loss and decrease in waist circumference in obese women with PCOS who had previously been poor responders regarding weight reduction on metformin monotherapy. © 2014 The authors.","","Adult; Body Weight; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Metformin; Obesity; Receptors, Glucagon; Waist Circumference; Weight Loss; androstenedione; liraglutide; metformin; add on therapy; adult; article; body mass; clinical article; combination chemotherapy; controlled study; diarrhea; disease severity; drug dose increase; drug dose titration; drug response; female; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; human; hypoglycemia; impaired glucose tolerance; injection site rash; insomnia; insulin resistance; metabolic syndrome X; monotherapy; nausea; obesity; open study; ovary polycystic disease; patient satisfaction; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; short course therapy; waist circumference; weight change; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896270054"

Given the profound impact of obesity on cardiovascular disease (CVD), studies of lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, and surgical interventions must be reappraised to better define the roles of these approaches in preventing cardiovascular events. Recent clinical trials have attempted to quell the debate over macronutrient composition versus caloric restriction in the dietary approach to weight loss. Our interpretation of these results is that caloric reduction and adherence to diets are of greater consequence than the particular dietary content for weight reduction. For cardiovascular risk factor modification, however, specific macronutrient composition of the diet may have additional impact outside weight loss, although the ultimate relationship between various dietary macronutrients and clinical cardiovascular outcomes is unclear. Although pharmacotherapy has been used for decades to treat obesity, there currently are limited options and recurrent cautionary tales; therefore, we use these agents sparingly. Sibutramine, one of only two medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the long-term treatment of obesity, recently came under intense scrutiny because of a possible increase in cardiovascular events, and it now is contraindicated in patients with established CVD. Orlistat and its over-the-counter form, Alli (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), can induce modest weight loss but frequently are not tolerated because of unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects. Fortunately, there are new medications in phase 3 clinical trials that hold promise as potential alternatives for obesity treatment. Finally, bariatric surgery for morbid obesity refractory to lifestyle interventions has become considerably more common. Surgery can effectively reduce body weight and treat cardiovascular risk factors, particularly diabetes, with acceptable complication rates and should be considered a viable option for appropriate patients. Ongoing clinical trials will clarify the impact of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular events and mortality, as well as the role of surgery as a treatment option that may be considered earlier than currently recommended. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","","amfepramone; amiodarone; benzphetamine; cyclosporin; liraglutide; lorcaserin; multivitamin; phendimetrazine; phentermine; placebo; sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; warfarin; anastomosis leakage; article; bariatric surgery; biliopancreatic bypass; bleeding; blood pressure; caloric restriction; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial; constipation; deep vein thrombosis; defecation urgency; diabetes mellitus; dizziness; dosage schedule comparison; drug cost; drug dose comparison; drug induced headache; drug withdrawal; evening dosage; fecal spotting; feces incontinence; gastrectomy; gastric banding; gastrointestinal symptom; human; infection; insomnia; lifestyle modification; lung embolism; malnutrition; morbid obesity; nausea; obesity; patient compliance; pulse rate; Roux Y anastomosis; side effect; steatorrhea; surgical mortality; surgical technique; vertical sleeve gastrectomy; weight reduction; xerostomia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650225133"

The present randomized phase 3 trial assessed the efficacy of liraglutide in maintaining weight loss achieved with a low-calorie diet (LCD).Methods:Obese/overweight participants (≥18 years, body mass index ≥30 kg m-2 or ≥27 kg m-2 with comorbidities) who lost ≥5% of initial weight during a LCD run-in were randomly assigned to liraglutide 3.0 mg per day or placebo (subcutaneous administration) for 56 weeks. Diet and exercise counseling were provided throughout the trial. Co-primary end points were percentage weight change from randomization, the proportion of participants that maintained the initial ≥5% weight loss, and the proportion that lost ≥5% of randomization weight (intention-to-treat analysis). ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00781937.Results:Participants (n=422) lost a mean 6.0% (s.d. 0.9) of screening weight during run-in. From randomization to week 56, weight decreased an additional mean 6.2% (s.d. 7.3) with liraglutide and 0.2% (s.d. 7.0) with placebo (estimated difference-6.1% (95% class intervals-7.5 to-4.6), P<0.0001). More participants receiving liraglutide (81.4%) maintained the ≥5% run-in weight loss, compared with those receiving placebo (48.9%) (estimated odds ratio 4.8 (3.0; 7.7), P<0.0001), and 50.5% versus 21.8% of participants lost ≥5% of randomization weight (estimated odds ratio 3.9 (2.4; 6.1), P<0.0001). Liraglutide produced small but statistically significant improvements in several cardiometabolic risk factors compared with placebo. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were reported more frequently with liraglutide than placebo, but most events were transient, and mild or moderate in severity.Conclusion:Liraglutide, with diet and exercise, maintained weight loss achieved by caloric restriction and induced further weight loss over 56 weeks. Improvements in some cardiovascular disease-risk factors were also observed.

However, since the effects of adding insulin have only been evaluated in the short-term, effects on long-term clinical outcomes remain unknown. • Exenatide, a drug belonging to a new pharmacological class (incretin analogues), is marketed as a subcutaneously administered adjunct to inadequately effective oral antidiabetic therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes. • Three placebo-controlled trials lasting 7 months showed that adding exenatide to metformin and/or a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea yielded an HbA1c level of 7% or less in about 40% of patients treated with exenatide 10 μg twice a day, versus about 10% of patients on placebo. The potential impact of exenatide on morbidity and mortality is not known. • In two trials versus insulin glargine and in one trial versus insulin aspart (+ isophane insulin), exenatide was as effective as the various insulins in controlling HbA1c levels. • During clinical trials, patients receiving exenatide lost an average of about 2 kg after 6 months, while insulin was associated with a weight gain of about 2 kg. • There was a similar incidence of hypoglycaemia with exenatide and insulin. In patients treated with exenatide, concomitant use of a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea increases the risk of hypoglycaemia. • More than half of patients on exenatide experienced nausea, versus fewer than 10% of patients on insulin glargine. • The long-term consequences of the presence of antiexenatide antibodies on the effectiveness of treatment are not known. • Exenatide is administered in two subcutaneous injections a day, at fixed doses. Insulin is administered in one or several injections a day, at doses adjusted to self-monitored blood glucose levels. • Adding insulin rather than exenatide is a better option in general when oral antidiabetic therapy fails in patients with type 2 diabetes, as we have more experience with insulin and there is no evidence of important advantages with exenative. The latter should be reserved for situations in which weight gain is a major problem.","","Clinical Trials as Topic; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Therapy, Combination; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Injections, Subcutaneous; Metformin; Overweight; Peptides; Sulfonylurea Compounds; Venoms; Weight Gain; Weight Loss; amylin derivative; antibiotic agent; biguanide derivative; buformin; carbutamide; contraceptive agent; exendin 4; glibenclamide; glibornuride; gliclazide; glitazone derivative; glucose; insulin; insulin aspart; insulin glargine; isophane insulin; liraglutide; meglitinide; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; phenformin; pioglitazone; placebo; pramlintide; repaglinide; rosiglitazone; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea derivative; unindexed drug; vildagliptin; antidiabetic agent; drug derivative; glucagon like peptide 1; glycosylated hemoglobin; incretin; metformin; peptide; sulfonylurea derivative; venom; adjuvant therapy; agitation; article; birth defect; clinical trial; diabetes control; diarrhea; dizziness; dosage schedule comparison; dose response; drug blood level; drug competition; drug dose comparison; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug induced headache; drug marketing; drug mechanism; drug overdose; drug tolerability; drug treatment failure; drug withdrawal; dyspepsia; human; hypoglycemia; injection site reaction; monotherapy; morbidity; mortality; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; recommended drug dose; risk benefit analysis; side effect; teratogenicity; treatment outcome; vomiting; weight gain; weight reduction; chemically induced disorder; drug combination; drug effect; hypoglycemia; obesity; subcutaneous drug administration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36749059085"

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), such as exenatide and liraglutide, are currently employed successfully in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. GLP-1RA improve glycaemic control and stimulate satiety, leading to reductions in food intake and body weight. Besides gastric distension and peripheral vagal nerve activation, GLP-1RA induce satiety by influencing brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, and several routes of action have been proposed. This review summarises the evidence for a physiological role of GLP-1 in the central regulation of feeding behaviour and the different routes of action involved. Also, we provide an overview of presently available data on pharmacological stimulation of GLP-1 pathways leading to alterations in CNS activity, reductions in food intake and weight loss. © 2014 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain.","CNS; Feeding behaviour; Glucagon-like peptide 1; Obesity; Type 2 diabetes","Animals; Appetite; Body Weight; Central Nervous System; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; CNS; feeding behaviour; glucagon-like peptide 1; obesity; type 2 diabetes; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; incretin; liraglutide; appetite; article; body weight; caloric intake; central nervous system; energy balance; energy expenditure; feeding behavior; food intake; functional neuroimaging; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; hormonal regulation; hormone action; human; hypoglycemia; meta analysis (topic); non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pharmacological stimulation; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; regulatory mechanism; satiety; stomach distension; stomach emptying; vagus nerve; weight change; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897895162"

It appears to be efficacious in reducing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) up to 1.59% and promotes modest weight loss up to 3 kg with a low incidence of hypoglycemia and mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse events. Convenient weekly dosing could improve compliance and help attain sustained glycemic goals. Addressing obesity is an integral part of T2DM management and weight loss may contribute to better glycemic and cardiovascular benefits. Results of ongoing clinical trials on cardiovascular safety are important to determine the risk-to-benefit ratio. As with any drug, patient selection and ongoing monitoring will be important. If approved, dulaglutide will be the first weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist to be available in a ready-to-use pen device with an automatic injector.

Especially two of the most efficacious antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, cause weight gain and metabolic disturbances. Additionally, patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders not infrequently consume alcohol. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has shown to improve glycaemic control and reduce alcohol intake among patients with type 2 diabetes. Objectives: To investigate whether the beneficial effects of GLP-1 analogues on glycaemic control and alcohol intake, in patients with type 2 diabetes, can be extended to a population of pre-diabetic psychiatric patients receiving antipsychotic treatment. Methods and analysis: Trial design, intervention and participants: The study is a 16-week, double-blinded, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial, designed to evaluate the effects of the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide on glycaemic control and alcohol intake compared to placebo in patients who are prediabetic, overweight (body mass index ≥27 kg/m2), diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and on stable treatment with either clozapine or olanzapine. Outcomes: The primary endpoint is the change in glucose tolerance from baseline (measured by area under the curve for the plasma glucose excursion following a 4 h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test) to follow-up at week 16. The secondary endpoints include changes of dysglycaemia, body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, secretion of incretin hormones, insulin sensitivity and β cell function, dual-energy X-ray absorption scan (body composition), lipid profile, liver function and measures of quality of life, daily functioning, severity of the psychiatric disease and alcohol consumption from baseline to follow-up at week 16. Status: Currently recruiting patients. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained. Before screening, all patients will be provided oral and written information about the trial. The study will be disseminated by peer-review publications and conference presentations.

Pioglitazone is efficacious in improving glycemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Although generally well-tolerated, pioglitazone was withdrawn by some national medicines agencies (e.g. in France and Germany) due to reports of increased incidence of bladder cancer. In this article, we review the literature on the association between pioglitazone and cancer in several sites, including the bladder. Pioglitazone, like other TZDs, increased differentiation, inhibited growth and proliferation, while provoked apoptosis in various cancer cells, including bladder cancer, in vitro and in vivo. However, a rat-specific carcinogenic effect of pioglitazone on the bladder was noted in vivo. Clinical data for the risk of various cancer sites mostly come from observational studies and are subject to bias. An increased risk for bladder cancer by pioglitazone was suggested by retrospective analyses. This risk was associated with the time of exposure and the age, by identifying 24 months and 65 years, respectively, as time 'thresholds' above which this risk becomes relevant. In contrast, no increased risk for bladder cancer was associated with pioglitazone in randomized clinical trials. Pioglitazone was associated with increased incidence of melanoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and decreased risk of renal cancer in one cohort study. These findings need to be re-evaluated on a prospective basis. There is no convincing evidence that pioglitazone increases or decreases the risk of cancer in other sites. In contrast, it was suggested that this drug may be useful either in the treatment of cancer complications or as an adjunct to chemotherapeutic agents. Considering the clinical benefit from the use of pioglitazone it is reasonable to wait until data from ongoing clinical trials are available before reaching definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, the potential for increased risk of bladder cancer should be taken into consideration, especially in the presence of other risk factors for bladder carcinogenesis (e.g. smoking). © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Bladder; Cancer; Pioglitazone; Safety; Type 2 diabetes","Animals; Carcinogens; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Neoplasms; PPAR gamma; Risk; Thiazolidinediones; angiogenic factor; cyclin D1; cyclooxygenase 2; exendin 4; fatty acid binding protein; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; glibenclamide; gliclazide; glimepiride; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; incretin; liraglutide; matrilysin; metformin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; pioglitazone; platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor; prostaglandin E2; protein p53; rosiglitazone; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2; triacylglycerol; troglitazone; apoptosis; article; bile duct carcinoma; bladder cancer; bladder carcinogenesis; body mass; breast cancer; cancer cell culture; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cancer screening; cell cycle arrest; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; disease association; disease course; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug use; environmental factor; esophagus cancer; follow up; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin resistance; kidney cancer; kidney carcinoma; liver cell carcinoma; lung cancer; melanoma; meta analysis (topic); metastasis potential; neoplasm; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas cancer; placebo effect; priority journal; progression free survival; prostate cancer; protein expression; randomized controlled trial (topic); stomach adenocarcinoma; thyroid cancer; thyroid medullary carcinoma; triacylglycerol blood level; tumor volume; uterus cancer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881339060"

Research design and methods-We randomized 68 older individuals (mean age, 58 6 8 years) with overweight/obesity and prediabetes to this double-blind study of liraglutide 1.8 mg versus placebo for 14 weeks. All subjects were advised to decrease calorie intake by 500 kcal/day. Peripheral insulin resistance was quantified by measuring the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration during the insulin suppression test. Traditional CVD risk factors and inflammatory markers also were assessed. Results-Eleven out of 35 individuals (31%) assigned to liraglutide discontinued the study compared with 6 out of 33 (18%) assigned to placebo (P = 0.26). Subjectswho continued to use liraglutide (n = 24) lost twice as much weight as those using placebo (n = 27; 6.8 vs. 3.3 kg; P , 0.001). Liraglutide-treated subjects also had a significant improvement in SSPG concentration (23.2 vs. 0.2 mmol/L; P,0.001) and significantly (P#0.04) greater lowering of systolic blood pressure (28.1 vs.22.6mmHg), fasting glucose (20.5 vs. 0mmol/L), and triglyceride (20.4 vs. 20.1 mmol/L) concentration. Inflammatory markers did not differ between the two groups, but pulse increased after liraglutide treatment (6.4 vs. 20.9 bpm; P = 0.001). Conclusions-The addition of liraglutide to calorie restriction significantly augmented weight loss and improved insulin resistance, systolic blood pressure, glucose, and triglyceride concentration in this population at high risk for development of T2DM and CVD. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Body Weight; Caloric Restriction; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Double-Blind Method; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Prediabetic State; Triglycerides; Weight Loss; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; octreotide; placebo; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; article; caloric intake; cardiovascular disease; clinical article; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug dose reduction; drug dose titration; drug effect; female; glucose blood level; high risk population; human; impaired glucose tolerance; inflammation; insulin resistance; male; obesity; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; systolic blood pressure; unspecified side effect; weight reduction; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891883623"

Obese patients without diabetes of our interdisciplinary obesity centre were treated off-label with GLP-1-agonists for different time periods. Application was started with low-dose and increased if side effects were tolerable. Monthly costs were € 125 for daily applications of 1.2 mg liraglutide or 10 μg exenatide twice daily. Data were obtained by telephone interviews about baseline characteristics, weight loss, sensation of satiation, duration of therapy, side effects, and reasons for discontinuation. Of 43 included cases (5 males, mean age 43±11 years, mean weight 107±24 kg, mean excess weight 35±21 kg) 7 were treated with exenatide and 36 with liraglutide. Excess weight loss in linear regression models was 6.7% per month (p <0.05) under control of age, sex, initial weight, and type of GLP-1 analogue treatment and did not significantly differ between liraglutide and exenatide. Overall, 58% of patients reported side effects mostly concerning the gastrointestinal tract. Surprisingly no patient reported vomiting. One patient developed a severe pancreatitis. At time of telephone interview only 30.2% were continuing treatment. Mean treatment duration was 2.98±2.71 months. Common reasons for discontinuation of treatment were no/little effect on weight loss (27.9%), intolerable side effects (20.9%), or financial reasons (14%). GLP-1 agonist treatment in obese patients without diabetes also correlates with significant weight loss in clinical practice. However, side effects and discontinuation of treatment are common. Therefore, long-term effect on weight loss might not be as promising as suggested by data from clinical trials. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.","exenatide; liraglutide; nondiabetic; obesity; weight loss","Adult; Aged; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Liraglutide; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Obesity; Off-Label Use; Peptides; Treatment Outcome; Venoms; Weight Loss; Young Adult; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; liraglutide; antidiabetic agent; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; peptide; venom; abdominal pain; adult; Article; clinical article; constipation; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; disease severity; dizziness; drug cost; drug dose increase; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; female; flatulence; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; health care financing; heartburn; human; leg edema; male; obesity; off label drug use; pancreatitis; priority journal; pustule; satiety; side effect; tachycardia; treatment duration; vomiting; weight reduction; aged; agonists; drug effects; economics; medication compliance; middle aged; obesity; treatment outcome; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84933504502"

Recently, concern has emerged that antihyperglycemic medications may also be associated with an increased prevalence of multiple cancers; however, available data are limited and conflicting. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) convened a conference to review factors associated with cancer development in people with obesity and diabetes and to discuss the possible cancer risk of antihyperglycemic medications. Increased body mass index is associated with an increased risk of multiple cancers based on observational epidemiological data, and is closely associated with increased levels of endogenous insulin, insulin-like growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and other factors that can have downstream pro-cancer growth effects. The role of hyperglycemia in cancer development is less clear, but an association cannot be ruled out, as current observational data additionally suggest an increased cancer risk in people with diabees. There is currently insufficient evidence that antihyperglycemic medications may be definitively associated with an increased cancer risk owing to a lack of data from large-scale randomized study designs. Similarly, there is also insufficient evidence showing a positive impact of these medications on cancer development. Clinicians can continue to confidently prescribe all FDA-approved antihyperglycemic medications for the management of hyperglycemia according to established practice guidelines. In patients who have an elevated cancer risk or positive family history of cancer, the cautious selection of antihyperglycemic medications is both prudent and warranted. The AACE additionally advocates for the improved treatment and management of obesity, early cancer screening in patients at increased risk, increased research collaboration, and improved study designs to address outstanding concerns surrounding the diabetes-cancer relationship.© 2013 AACE.","","Diabetes Mellitus; Endocrinology; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Neoplasms; Obesity; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Societies, Medical; United States; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; antidiabetic agent; C peptide; calcitonin; canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; exendin 4; glibenclamide; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; glucose; incretin; insulin; insulin glargine; liraglutide; metformin; pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; sitagliptin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; somatomedin; sulfonylurea; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis; acute pancreatitis; article; bladder cancer; body mass; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; colon cancer; diabetes mellitus; disease association; endometrium cancer; epidemiological data; high risk patient; human; hyperglycemia; inflammation; liver cancer; lung cancer; malignant neoplastic disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; oropharynx cancer; pancreas cancer; pancreatitis; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk factor; side effect; thyroid cancer; thyroid carcinoma; complication; diabetes mellitus; endocrinology; hyperglycemia; medical society; Neoplasms; obesity; practice guideline; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883399648"

The addition of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) to basal insulin therapy has been shown to reduce insulin requirement while reducing insulin-associated weight gain [1,2]. The effect of GLP-1 RA therapy added to intensive (basal/bolus) insulin therapy has not been studied in a prospective trial. This trial evaluated the effect of the addition of liraglutide to high-dose intensive insulin therapy compared with standard insulin up-titration in obese insulin-resistant patients with type 2 diabetes requiring high-dose insulin therapy. Methods: Thirty-seven subjects with type 2 diabetes requiring >100 units of insulin daily administered either by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or by multiple daily injections (MDIs) with or without metformin were randomized to receive either liraglutide plus insulin (LIRA) or intensive insulin only (controls). Liraglutide was initiated at 0.6mg subcutaneously (sq) per day and increased to either 1.2 or 1.8mg daily in combination with intensive insulin therapy. Controls received intensive insulin up-titration only. Results: At 6months, subjects receiving liraglutide plus insulin experienced statistically significant reductions in HbA1c, weight, insulin dose and glycaemic variability (GV) by continuous glucose monitor (CGM) compared with the control group receiving insulin only. Conclusions: Adding liraglutide to intensive high-dose (basal/bolus) insulin therapy results in greater improvement in glycaemic control than insulin therapy alone, with additional benefits of weight loss and reduced GV. © 2014 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.","GLP-1 analogue; Insulin intensive management; Insulin resistance; Insulin therapy; Type 2 diabetes","Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Liraglutide; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; insulin; liraglutide; add on therapy; adult; article; blood glucose monitoring; clinical article; controlled study; diabetic obesity; drug dose increase; drug dose regimen; drug effect; drug megadose; female; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; hypoglycemic coma; insulin infusion; insulin resistance; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; standard; weight reduction; analogs and derivatives; blood; body mass; body weight; combination drug therapy; comparative study; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug administration; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; metabolism; obesity; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905729436"

Prediabetes, which is defined as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), increases the risk of development of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle improvements, including weight loss and increased physical activity are effective in reducing the conversion of IGT to type 2 diabetes by 58%. However, lifestyle interventions alone may be difficult to maintain. Oral pharmacological agents used to treat type 2 diabetes that improve insulin sensitivity, preserve beta cell function and delay carbohydrate metabolism have been shown to prevent the progression of IGT to type 2 diabetes. The risk reduction of diabetes using metformin, pioglitazone, acarbose, valsartan and orlistat in clinical studies has ranged from 14 to 72%. Therefore, persons with IGT tolerance may benefit from pharmacological therapy to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. Copyright © 2013 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

However, it remained uncertain whether such liraglutide-induced improvement is maintained after discharge from the hospital. The aim of the present study was to determine the long-term effects of liraglutide on body weight, glycemic control, and eating behavior in Japanese obese type 2 diabetics.Methods: Patients with obesity (body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2) and type 2 diabetes were hospitalized at Osaka University Hospital between November 2010 and December 2011. BMI and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were examined on admission, at discharge and at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge. For the liraglutide group (BMI; 31.3 ± 5.3 kg/m2, n = 29), patients were introduced to liraglutide after correction of hyperglycemic by insulin or oral glucose-lowering drugs and maintained on liraglutide after discharge. Eating behavior was assessed in patients treated with liraglutide using The Guideline For Obesity questionnaire issued by the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity, at admission, discharge, 3 and 6 months after discharge. For the insulin group (BMI; 29.1 ± 3.0 kg/m2, n = 28), each patient was treated with insulin during hospitalization and glycemic control maintained by insulin after discharge.Results: Liraglutide induced significant and persistent weight loss from admission up to 6 months after discharge, while no change in body weight after discharge was noted in the insulin group. Liraglutide produced significant improvements in all major scores of eating behavior questionnaire items and such effect was maintained at 6 months after discharge. Weight loss correlated significantly with the decrease in scores for recognition of weight and constitution, sense of hunger, and eating style.Conclusion: Liraglutide produced meaningful long-term weight loss and significantly improved eating behavior in obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2012 Fujishima et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Diabetes; Eating behavior; Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1); Incretin; Liraglutide; Obesity","Aged; Anti-Obesity Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biological Markers; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Chi-Square Distribution; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Feeding Behavior; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; liraglutide; oral antidiabetic agent; adult; aged; article; body mass; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diabetic patient; drug dose increase; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug substitution; feeding behavior; female; glycemic control; hemoglobin blood level; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; hyperglycemia; insulin treatment; Japanese; long term care; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; questionnaire; structured questionnaire; treatment outcome; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866152721"

This gap is surprising given the high prevalence and associated costs of obesity. Many factors have prevented active drug development, including the poor safety and efficacy of earlier antiobesity drugs. However, there are now several compelling targets on the horizon. The new generation of antiobesity drugs offers hope for the management of obesity, but no single agent is likely to be a panacea. Rather, obesity will need to be managed like many other chronic diseases, with combination therapies and long-term treatment in order to achieve sustained success. New targets have arisen as more research has been performed to understand the complex circuitry that controls energy homeostasis.

Methods: Subjects completing 104weeks (52-week main trial BEGIN ONCE-LONG + 52-week extension) on insulin degludec (IDeg) OD + metformin with HbA1c≥7.0% (≥53mmol/mol) were randomized to IDeg+Lira [n=88, mean HbA1c: 7.7% (61mmol/mol)] or IDeg+IAsp (n=89, mean HbA1c: 7.7%) for 26weeks, continuing metformin. Subjects completing 104weeks with HbA1c <7.0% continued IDeg+metformin in a third, non-randomized arm (n=236). Results: IDeg+Lira reduced HbA1c (-0.74%-points) significantly more than IDeg+IAsp (-0.39%-points); estimated treatment difference (ETD) (IDeg+Lira-IDeg+IAsp) -0.32%-points (95% CI -0.53; -0.12); p=0.0024. More IDeg+Lira (49.4%) than IDeg+IAsp (7.2%) subjects achieved HbA1c <7.0% without confirmed hypoglycaemia [plasma glucose <3.1mmol/l (<56mg/dl) or severe hypoglycaemia) and without weight gain; estimated odds ratio (IDeg+Lira/IDeg+IAsp) 13.79 (95% CI 5.24; 36.28); p<0.0001. IDeg+Lira subjects had significantly less confirmed and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia, and significantly greater weight loss (-2.8kg) versus IDeg+IAsp (+0.9kg); ETD (IDeg+Lira-IDeg+IAsp) -3.75kg (95% CI -4.70; -2.79); p<0.0001. Other than more gastrointestinal side effects with IDeg+Lira, no safety differences occurred.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with significant microvascular and macrovascular disease, with considerable impact on morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence has cast uncertainty on the benefits of very tight glycaemic goals in these individuals. The natural history of disease follows an insidious course from disordered glucose metabolism in a pre-diabetic state, often with metabolic syndrome and obesity, before proceeding to diabetes mellitus. In the research setting, lifestyle, pharmacological and surgical intervention targeted against obesity and glycaemia has shown that metabolic disturbances can be halted and indeed regressed if introduced at an early stage of disease. In addition to traditional anti-diabetic medications such as the glinides, sulphonylureas and the glitazones, novel therapies manipulating the endocannabinoid system, neurotransmitters, intestinal absorption and gut hormones have shown dual benefit in weight loss and glycaemic control normalisation. Whilst these treatments will not and should not replace lifestyle change, they will act as invaluable adjuncts for weight loss and aid in normalising the metabolic profile of individuals at risk of diabetes. Utilizing novel therapies to prevent diabetes should be the focus of future research, with the aim of preventing the challenging microvascular and macrovascular complications, and ultimately cardiovascular death. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cardiometabolic; Cardiovascular disease; Diabetes; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity; Preventive medicine; Renin-angiotensinaldosterone system; Vascular disease; Weight loss","Anti-Obesity Agents; Bariatric Surgery; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diet, Reducing; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Life Style; Metabolic Syndrome X; Obesity; Treatment Outcome; acarbose; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; amfebutamone; antidiabetic agent; candesartan hexetil; chlortalidone; exendin 4; gastrointestinal hormone; glitazone derivative; hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; lisinopril; metformin; naltrexone; phentermine plus topiramate; ramipril; rimonabant; rosiglitazone; sibutramine; sulfonylurea derivative; tetrahydrolipstatin; voglibose; article; bariatric surgery; cardiovascular risk; diabetes mellitus; diet; disease course; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glycemic control; human; lifestyle modification; metabolic syndrome X; microangiopathy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); pregnancy diabetes mellitus; randomized controlled trial (topic); renin angiotensin aldosterone system; weight reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897386965"

It acts in a glucose-dependent manner. In controlled trials, it was observed that it produce short-term glucose lowering effects, with the reduction of HbA1C of up to 1.3 % which is comparable with oral agents. The beneficial effects observed for liraglutide was on reduction of weight (1-3.4 kg) and blood pressure (2.1-6.7mmHg). The formation of antibodies against Liraglutide was comparatively less than that of exenatide.

We determined whether addition of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue could reverse pronounced insulin-associated weight gain while maintaining glycaemic control, and compared this with the most practised strategy, continuation and intensification of standard insulin therapy. Methods: In a 26-week, randomised controlled trial (ELEGANT), conducted in the outpatient departments of one academic and one large non-academic teaching hospital in the Netherlands, adult patients with type 2 diabetes with ≥4% weight gain during short-term (≤16 months) insulin therapy received either open-label addition of liraglutide 1.8 mg/day (n = 26) or continued standard therapy (n = 24). A computer-generated random number list was used to allocate treatments. Participants were evaluated every 4-6 weeks for weight, glycaemic control and adverse events. The primary endpoint was between-group weight difference after 26 weeks of treatment (intention to treat). Results: Of 50 randomised patients (mean age 58 years, BMI 33 kg/m2, HbA 1c7.4% [57 mmol/mol]), 47 (94%) completed the study; all patients were analysed. Body weight decreased by 4.5 kg with liraglutide and increased by 0.9 kg with standard therapy (mean difference -5.2 kg [95% CI -6.7, -3.6 kg]; p ;lt0.001). The respective changes in HbA1c were -0.77% (-8.4 mmol/mol) and +0.01% (+0.1 mmol/mol) (difference -0.74% [-8.1 mmol/mol]) ([95% CI -1.08%, -0.41%] [-11.8, -4.5 mmol/mol]; p ;lt0.001); respective changes in insulin dose were -29 U/day and +5 U/day (difference -33 U/day [95% CI -41, -25 U/day]; p ;lt0.001). In five patients (19%), insulin could be completely discontinued. Liraglutide was well tolerated; no severe adverse events or severe hypoglycaemia occurred. Conclusions/interpretation: In patients with pronounced insulin-associated weight gain, addition of liraglutide to their treatment regimen reverses weight, decreases insulin dose and improves glycaemic control, and hence seems a valuable therapeutic option compared with continuation of standard insulin treatment.

Type 2 diabetes confers significant morbidity and mortality, most notably with target organ damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. The magnitude of cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes is best illustrated by its position as a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. Complications related to neuropathy are also vast, often working in concert with vascular abnormalities and resulting in serious clinical consequences such as foot ulceration. Increased understanding of the natural history of this disorder has generated the potential to intervene and halt pathological progression before overt disease ensues, after which point management becomes increasingly challenging. The concept of prediabetes as a formal diagnosis has begun to be translated from the research setting to clinical practice, but with continually updated guidelines, varied nomenclature, emerging pharmacotherapies and an ever-changing evidence base, clinicians may be left uncertain of best practice in identifying and managing patients at the prediabetic stage. This review aims to summarize the epidemiological data, new concepts in disease pathogenesis and guideline recommendations in addition to lifestyle, pharmacological and surgical therapies targeted at stopping progression of prediabetes to diabetes. While antidiabetic medications, with newer anti-obesity medications and interventional bariatric procedures have shown some promising benefits, diet and therapeutic lifestyle change remains the mainstay of management to improve the metabolic profile of individuals with glucose dysregulation. New risk stratification tools to identify at-risk individuals, coupled with unselected population level intervention hold promise in future practice. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

This study investigated the effects of steady-state liraglutide 1.8mg versus placebo on postprandial plasma lipid concentrations after 3weeks of treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: In a cross-over trial, patients with T2DM (n=20, 18-75years, BMI 18.5-40kg/m2) were randomized to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (weekly dose escalation from 0.6 to 1.8mg) and placebo. After each 3-week period, a standardized fat-rich meal was provided, and the effects of liraglutide on triglyceride (primary endpoint AUC0-8h), apolipoprotein B48, non-esterified fatty acids, glycaemic responses and gastric emptying were assessed. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00993304. Funding: Novo Nordisk A/S. Results: After 3weeks, mean postprandial triglyceride (AUC0-8h liraglutide/placebo treatment-ratio 0.72, 95% CI [0.62-0.83], p=0.0004) and apolipoprotein B48 (AUC0-8h ratio 0.65 [0.58-0.73], p<0.0001) significantly decreased with liraglutide 1.8mg versus placebo, as did iAUC0-8h and Cmax (p<0.001). No significant treatment differences were observed for non-esterified fatty acids. Mean postprandial glucose and glucagon AUC0-8h and Cmax were significantly reduced with liraglutide versus placebo. Postprandial gastric emptying rate [assessed by paracetamol absorption (liquid phase) and the 13C-octanoate breath test (solid phase)] displayed no treatment differences. Mean low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol decreased significantly with liraglutide versus placebo. Conclusions: Liraglutide treatment in patients with T2DM significantly reduced postprandial excursions of triglyceride and apolipoprotein B48 after a fat-rich meal, independently of gastric emptying. Results indicate liraglutide's potential to reduce CVD risk via improvement of postprandial lipaemia. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd 15 11 November 2013 10.1111/dom.12133 ORIGINAL ARTICLE ORIGINAL ARTICLES © 2013 The Authors.

We have reviewed the adverse effects on the cardiovascular system of anti-obesity drugs now retracted from the market as well as the cardiovascular profile of current drugs and potential pathways which are considered for treatment of obesity. Fenfluramine, and sibutramine were withdrawn due to increased cardiovascular risk, while an inverse agonist at cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors, rimonobant was withdrawn due to serious psychiatric problems. At present there are only few treatments available including orlistat and, phentermine alone or in combination with topiramate and lorcaserin, although cardiovascular side effects need to be clarified regarding phentermine and lorcaserin. Drugs approved for type 2 diabetes including glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) analogues and metformin also cause moderate weight losses and have a favourable cardiovascular profile, while the anti-obesity potential of nebivolol remains unexplored.

Methods: Prospective study in 59 consecutive overweight or obese (BMI≥25kg/m2) T2DM patients unable to achieve glycemic control (HbA1c>7%, 53mmol/mol) with metformin alone or in association with sulfonylurea that require initiation of liraglutide in progressive dose increase up to 1.8mg/day subcutaneously. Weight, body composition, blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, insulin, plasma lipids, adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin and visfatin) as well as cardiovascular biomarkers (IL-6 and TNF-a) levels were measured fasting at baseline and 14 weeks after liraglutide initiation. Results: 14 weeks of liraglutide treatment significantly reduced HbA1c, BMI and total body fat mass by 0.9%, 1.4kg/m2 and 0.5% respectively. Statistically significant lower insulin resistance and higher insulin secretion was found by HOMA-IR 8.4 (1.6) vs 4.6 (0.9)molmIU/L2 and HOMA-B 48.2 (9.0) vs 87.6 (16.3)μIU/mmol. Statistically significantly higher levels of visfatin 6.3 (2.1) vs 6.8 (2.1)ng/ml and resistin 3.6 (2.0) vs 4.3 (2.3)ng/ml were also observed after treatment. Baseline visfatin was negatively correlated with basal fasting plasma glucose r=-0.360 (p<0.05). Conclusions: Liraglutide treatment for 14 weeks in daily clinical practice led to reduction of BMI and improvement of glucose control and insulin sensitivity and resistance parameters. Additionally, circulating levels of adipokines and pro-inflammatory factors could play an important role in GLP-1 treatment response. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Adipocytokines; GLP-1 analogs; Liraglutide; Type 2 diabetes; Visfatin","Adipokines; Biological Markers; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin Resistance; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; adipocytokine; adiponectin; biological marker; C peptide; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; liraglutide; metformin; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; resistin; sulfonylurea; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipocytokine; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose blood level; liraglutide; adult; article; blood pressure; body composition; body fat; body mass; body weight; cardiovascular risk; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug dose increase; female; glucose blood level; glycemic control; hemoglobin blood level; human; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prospective study; protein analysis; protein blood level; protein function; treatment duration; treatment response; analogs and derivatives; blood; cardiovascular disease; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; metabolism; middle aged; physiology; risk factor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898539437"

In long-term clinical trials, therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists has been associated with improvements in blood pressure but also with increases in heart rate (HR). In the present study, we assessed the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and HR in overweight T2DM patients. A total of 85 overweight T2DM patients were included in the study (43 on exenatide and 42 on liraglutide) and followed up for 13 and 22 months. Treatment with exenatide caused a significant decrease in SBP from 146±20 to 140±15 mm Hg (p=0.03), while DBP (from 88±10 to 85±7 mm Hg (p=0.1)) and HR (from 78±10 to 78±12 beats/min (p=0.9)) did not change significantly. Treatment with liraglutide caused a significant decrease in SBP from 145±20 to 135±18 mm Hg (p=0.005) and DBP from 88±8 to 82±8 mm Hg (p<0.001), while HR (from 78±14 to 73±8 beats/min (p=0.2)) did not change significantly. The results of our study suggest that therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide may significantly reduce SBP and DBP by 6 to 10 mm Hg. © 2014, Vuk Vrhovac Institute.

Nausea was the most frequent side effect.Objective: To evaluate routinely collected data on nausea and vomiting among individuals on liraglutide and their influence on tolerability and body weight.Design:A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 20-week study with an 84-week extension (sponsor unblinded at 20 weeks, open-label after 1 year) in eight European countries (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00422058).Subjects:After commencing a 500-kcal/day deficit diet plus exercise, 564 participants (18-65 years, body mass index (BMI) 30-40 kg m-2) were randomly assigned (after a 2-week run-in period) to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0 mg), placebo or open-label orlistat (120 mg × 3 per day). After 1 year, participants on liraglutide/placebo switched to liraglutide 2.4 mg, and subsequently, to liraglutide 3.0 mg (based on 20-week and 1-year results, respectively). Results: The intention-to-treat population comprised 561 participants (n=90-98 per arm, age 45.9±10.3 years, BMI 34.8±2.7 kg m-2 (mean±s.d.)). In year 1, more participants reported ≥1 episode of nausea/vomiting on treatment with liraglutide 1.2-3.0 mg (17-38%) than with placebo or orlistat (both 4%, P≤0.001). Most episodes occurred during dose escalation (weeks 1-6), with 'mild' or 'moderate' symptoms. Among participants on liraglutide 3.0 mg, 48% reported some nausea and 13% some vomiting, with considerable variation between countries, but only 4 out of 93 (4%) reported withdrawals. The mean 1-year weight loss on treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg from randomization was 9.2 kg for participants reporting nausea/vomiting episodes, versus 6.3 kg for those with none (a treatment difference of 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval 0.5-5.3); P=0.02). Both weight losses were significantly greater than the respective weight losses for participants on placebo (P<0.001) or orlistat (P<0.05). Quality-of-life scores at 20 weeks improved similarly with or without nausea/vomiting on treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg. Conclusion: Transient nausea and vomiting on treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg was associated with greater weight loss, although symptoms appeared tolerable and did not attenuate quality-of-life improvements. Improved data collection methods on nausea are warranted. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","GLP-1 analog; liraglutide; nausea; quality of life; vomiting; weight loss","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Mass Index; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Europe; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nausea; Obesity; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome; Vomiting; Weight Loss; liraglutide; placebo; tetrahydrolipstatin; antiobesity agent; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; abdominal pain; adult; aged; article; body mass; body weight; caloric intake; constipation; controlled study; diarrhea; double blind procedure; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug induced headache; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; evening dosage; exercise; female; human; incidence; insulin injection pen; kinesiotherapy; major clinical study; male; nausea and vomiting; obesity; open study; optimal drug dose; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; retching; self report; treatment outcome; visual impairment; weight reduction; adolescent; analogs and derivatives; chemically induced; clinical trial; dose response; drug administration; drug effects; Europe; middle aged; multicenter study; nausea; obesity; severity of illness index; vomiting; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899906592"

Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Electronic and manual searches were combined. Study selection: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on lixisenatide versus placebo or active comparators for type 2 diabetes were included. Participants: Individual patient data were retrieved to calculate outcomes for patients with elevated liver blood tests. Main outcome measures: Normalisation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Data synthesis: The results of included trials were combined in meta-analyses. Sequential, subgroup and regression analyses were performed to evaluate heterogeneity and bias. Results: We included 12 RCTs on lixisenatide versus placebo and 3 RCTs with the active comparators liraglutide, exenatide or sitagliptin. The mean treatment duration was 29 weeks. Lixisenatide increased the proportion of patients with normalisation of ALT (risk difference: 0.07; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.14; number needed to treat: 14 patients, p=0.042). The effect was not confirmed in sequential analysis. No effects of lixisenatide were identified on AST, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin. No evidence of bias was identified. Mixed effect multilevel meta-regression analyses suggest that the benefit of lixisenatide on ALT was limited to patients who were overweight or obese. Conclusions: This review suggests that lixisenatide increases the proportion of obese or overweight patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve normalisation of ALT. Additional research is needed to determine if the findings translate to clinical outcome measures. Trial registration number: PROSPERO; CRD42013005779. © 2014, BMJ Publishing Group.

In fact, orlistat is the only available long-term treatment for obesity. Areas covered: The efficacy and safety of long-term drug therapy is very important in the management obesity; for this reason, the authors decided to conduct a review on the efficacy and safety of current, past and future pharmacotherapies for weight loss. Expert opinion: Orlistat is a good choice for the treatment of obesity, because of its safety on cardiovascular events and its positive effects on diabetic control, even if it is not as effective as rimonabant or sibutramine in reducing body weight. Regarding emerging anti-obesity therapies in diabetic people, we currently have drugs that have already been marketed including the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide; other than improving glycemic control, they also suppress appetite reducing body weight. Moreover, some other drugs are currently in study such as tesofensine, phentermine + topiramate, bupropion + naltrexone and bupropion + zonisamide.

Nevertheless, much less research has been aimed at elucidating the role of GLP-1 in lipid metabolism and in particular postprandial dyslipidemia. Exenatide and liraglutide are two GLP-1 receptor agonists which are currently available as subcutaneously administered treatment for T2DM but their chronic effects on postprandial lipaemia have not been well investigated. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of treatment with either liraglutide or exenatide for two weeks on postprandial lipaemia in obese subjects with T2DM. This study was a single-center, two-armed, randomized, controlled 2-week prospective intervention trial in 20 subjects with T2DM. Patients were randomized to receive either liraglutide or exenatide treatment and underwent a standardized meal tolerance test early in the morning after 10 h fast at baseline (visit 1, beginning of treatment) and after a two-week treatment period (visit 2). Exenatide and liraglutide both appear to be equally effective in lowering postprandial lipaemia after the first administration and after a two-week treatment. The mechanisms which lead to this phenomenon, which seem to be independent of gastric emptying, are yet to be studied. © 2014 Maria Voukali et al.","","Adult; Aged; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Peptides; Postprandial Period; Prospective Studies; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Venoms; exendin 4; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; insulin; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; antidiabetic agent; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; liraglutide; peptide; venom; adult; Article; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; drug dose increase; drug efficacy; female; glycemic control; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; intervention study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; postprandial state; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; stomach emptying; thigh circumference; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; aged; analogs and derivatives; blood; comparative study; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Hyperlipidemias; prospective study; time; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927973229"

This relationship is so close that some authors have defined Alzheimer Disease as Type 3 Diabetes. Numerous studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes have twice the incidence of sporadic AD. Insulin deficiency or insulin resistance facilitates cerebral β-amyloidogenesis in murine model of AD, accompanied by a significant elevation in APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) and BACE1 (β-site APP Cleaving Enzime 1). Similarly, deposits of Aβ produce a loss of neuronal surface insulin receptors and directly interfere with the insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, as it is well known, these disorders are both associated to an increased cardiovascular risk and an altered cholesterol metabolism, so we have analyzed several therapies which recently have been suggested as a remedy to treat together AD and DM. The aim of the present review is to better understand the strengths and drawbacks of these therapies. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Alzheimer's disease; Liraglutide; Metformin; Statins; Type 2 diabetes","Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hypercholesterolemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Male; Metformin; Receptor, Insulin; Risk Factors; tau Proteins; advanced glycation end product; aminoguanidine; atorvastatin; cholesterol; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; metformin; mevinolin; pitavastatin; placebo; pravastatin; pyridoxamine; simvastatin; tenilsetam; absence of side effects; Alzheimer disease; article; astrocytoma; cardiovascular risk; cognition; controlled clinical trial (topic); diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; diabetic retinopathy; disease association; drug effect; glucose metabolism; human; insulin deficiency; insulin release; insulin resistance; ischemic heart disease; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; risk assessment; senile plaque; signal transduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878643703"

Methods: Seven hundred and thirty-two patients with type 2 diabetes completed a 77-item questionnaire during a randomized, 52-week, double-blind study with liraglutide 1.2 mg (n = 245) or 1.8 mg (n = 242) compared with glimepiride 8 mg (n = 245).Results: Mean (SE) decreases in glycated haemoglobin levels were greater with liraglutide 1.2 mg [-0.84 (0.08)%] and 1.8 mg [-1.14 (0.08)%] than glimepiride [-0.51 (0.08)%; p = 0.0014 and p < 0.0001, respectively]. Patients gained weight on glimepiride [mean (SE), 1.12 (0.27) kg] but lost weight on liraglutide [1.2 mg: -2.05 (0.28) kg; 1.8 mg: -2.45 (0.28) kg; both p < 0.0001]. Patient weight assessment was more favourable with liraglutide 1.8 mg [mean (SE) score: 40.0 (2.0)] than glimepiride [48.7 (2.0); p = 0.002], and liraglutide 1.8 mg patients were 52% less likely to feel overweight [odds ratio (OR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.331-0.696].

The enrolled subjects were 86 T2D patients [age; 59.8 ± 12.8 years, duration of diabetes; 15.8 ± 9.5 years, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); 8.5 ± 1.5%, body mass index (BMI); 27.3 ± 5.4 kg/m2 (15.8 - 46.5 kg/m2), mean ± SD]. Among 86 subjects, liraglutide was introduced in 25 inpatients and 61 outpatients, and 46 subjects were followed for 2 years. Clinical parameters were measured at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after liraglutide introduction. The increase in liraglutide dosage and the additional usage of glucose-lowering agents depended on each attending physician.; Background: Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has been shown to possess pleiotropic effects including body weight reduction. However, long-term effect of liraglutide on body weight and glycemic control has not been elucidated in Japanese type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects. Present study investigates whether liraglutide treatment maintains the body weight-decreasing and glucose-lowering effects for 2 years in Japanese T2D subjects.; Results: At 1 year after liraglutide introduction, 69 patients (80.2%) decreased body weight and 58 patients (67.4%) improved glycemic control. Body mass index (BMI) was changed 27.3 ± 5.4 kg/m2 to 25.9 ± 4.8 kg/m2and percent reduction of body weight was significant and maintained over 4% at 2 years after liraglutide introduction. HbA1c was significantly decreased from 8.5 ± 1.5% to 7.7 ± 1.2% for 2 years. Liraglutide treatment tended to ameliorate lipid profile and hepatic enzymes. Stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that baseline BMI and previous insulin dose were positively associated with body weight reduction and baseline HbA1c was positively associated with reduction of HbA1c at 2 years after liraglutide introduction.; Conclusions: Long-term liraglutide treatment effectively maintained the reduction of body weight and the fair glycemic control, and also improved lipid profile and liver enzymes in Japanese T2D subjects. © 2014Inoue et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Diabetes; Eating behavior; Glucagon-like peptide-1; Liraglutide; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity","alanine aminotransferase; antidiabetic agent; aspartate aminotransferase; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body mass; cholesterol blood level; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial; diabetic patient; disease duration; drug dose increase; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug megadose; female; follow up; glycemic control; hemoglobin blood level; human; insulin treatment; Japanese (people); long term care; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; outpatient; triacylglycerol blood level; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907429444"

The data from the ABCD nationwide liraglutide audit (November 2009-June 2013; 6010 patients) provide an opportunity to assess the extent of the problem in routine clinical practice in the UK. Methods: At every patient visit, audit-contributors were invited to submit, via an electronic form, clinical data collected as part of routine clinical practice, including data on possible side effects of treatment. Cases of 'possible pancreatitis' were identified and we contacted the centres concerned to obtain full details. Results: To date, the audit has monitored 3720 years of exposure to liraglutide. There were four cases of possible pancreatitis documented from the 6010 patients on liraglutide: three patients had likely causes of pancreatitis identified and one patient had no aetiological cause. This sole case represents an incidence of 0.027/100 patient-years of exposure to liraglutide. Conclusion: In cases of acute pancreatitis of a patient on liraglutide, if another cause can be found (usually gall stones associated with obesity), the drug is not be necessarily culpable. People with Type 2 diabetes are at greater risk of acute pancreatitis (hazard ratio between 1.5 and 2.8). Thus, the possibility of liraglutide-associated pancreatitis in 'real-world' clinical practice (0.027/100 patient years) represents a very small risk.","Diabetes; exenatide; gall stones; GLP-1 receptor agonist; glucagon-like peptide-1; incretins; liraglutide; obesity; pancreatitis; risk; side effects; Type 2 diabetes","hemoglobin A1c; liraglutide; acromegaly; acute pancreatitis; article; clinical practice; drug exposure; gallbladder disease; gallstone; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypopituitarism; medical audit; multicenter study (topic); pancreatitis; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); United Kingdom","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887575854"

Preclinical data suggest that incretin-based therapies may also preserve β-cell function, holding promise of a truly disease-modifying therapy. This article examines clinical trial data and accepted algorithms with a view toward elucidating the application of these agents in routine clinical practice. We propose a systematic approach to treatment, addressing (1) patient selection, (2) optimal treatment combinations, and (3) timing and guidance for both initiation and intensification of therapy. The GLP-1 receptor agonists, for example, could be particularly beneficial in patients whose weight significantly increases cardiovascular risk. Early use of these agents may be effective in preventing diabetes in those at risk, or in halting or retarding disease progression in patients with frank diabetes. Additional clinical investigation will be required to test such hypotheses.

Recent treatment guidelines recommend the use of insulin, in particular basal insulin, as part of a treatment regimen earlier in the disease process. Many patients are reticent about initiating insulin, so therapies that allow insulin treatment to be more tailored to individual needs are likely to result in greater acceptance and patient adherence with therapy. To meet this need, a range of insulin products are in development that aim to increase absorption rate or prolong the duration of action, reduce peak variability and weight gain associated with insulin treatment, and offer alternative delivery methods.

Overweight is associated with brain deterioration, cognitive decline and poor quality of life, factors which are already compromised in normal weight patients with schizophrenia.Here we outline the current strategies against antipsychotic-induced weight gain, and we describe peripheral and cerebral effects of the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Moreover, we account for similarities in brain changes between schizophrenia and overweight patients.Discussion: Current interventions against antipsychotic-induced weight gain do not facilitate a substantial and lasting weight loss. GLP-1 analogs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes are associated with significant and sustained weight loss in overweight patients. Potential effects of treating schizophrenia patients with antipsychotic-induced weight gain with GLP-1 analogs are discussed.Conclusions: We propose that adjunctive treatment with GLP-1 analogs may constitute a new avenue to treat and prevent metabolic and cerebral deficiencies in schizophrenia patients with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Clinical research to support this idea is highly warranted. © 2012 Ebdrup et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","antipsychotic medication; cognition; diabetes; exenatide; GLP-1; liraglutide; neuroprotection; overweight; Schizophrenia","Antipsychotic Agents; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Obesity; Schizophrenia; Weight Gain; albiglutide; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 derivative; liraglutide; lixisenatide; neuroleptic agent; taspoglutide; article; cognition; diabetes mellitus; drug effect; drug induced disease; human; neuroprotection; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score; obesity; physiology; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); schizophrenia; weight gain; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864950589"

Objective: We investigated the effects of liraglutide on gastric emptying, glycemic parameters, appetite and energy metabolism in obese non-diabetic individuals. Design: Participants (N=49, 18-75 years, body mass index: 30-40 kg m-2) were randomized to two of three treatments: liraglutide 1.8 mg, 3.0 mg, or placebo in a double-blind, incomplete crossover trial. After 5 weeks, 24-h energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation were measured in a respiratory chamber Gastric emptying (acetaminophen absorption method), glycemic parameters and appetite were assessed during a 5-h meal test. Ad libitum energy intake during a subsequent lunch was also assessed. Results: Five-hour gastric emptying (AUC0-300 min) was found to be equivalent for liraglutide 1.8 versus 3.0 mg (primary end point), and for both liraglutide doses versus placebo, as 90% confidence intervals for the estimated treatment ratios were contained within the prespecified interval (0.80-1.25). However, 1-h gastric emptying was 23% lower than placebo with liraglutide 3.0 mg (P=0.007), and a nonsignificant 13% lower than placebo with liraglutide 1.8 mg (P=0.14). Both liraglutide doses similarly reduced fasting glucose (0.5-0.6 mmol l -1 versus placebo, P<0.0001), glucose Cmax and 1-h AUC versus placebo; only liraglutide 3.0 mg reduced iAUC0-300 min (by ~26% versus placebo, P=0.02). Glucagon iAUC0-300 min decreased by ~30%, and iAUC0-60 min for insulin and C-peptide was ~20% lower with both liraglutide doses versus placebo. Liraglutide doses similarly increased mean postprandial satiety and fullness ratings, reduced hunger and prospective food consumption and decreased ad libitum energy intake by ~16%. Liraglutide-associated reductions in EE were partly explained by a decrease in body weight. A relative shift toward increased fat and reduced carbohydrate oxidation was observed with liraglutide. Clinicaltrials.gov ID:NCT00978393. Funding: Novo Nordisk. Conclusion: Gastric emptying AUC0-300 min was equivalent for liraglutide 1.8 and 3.0 mg, and for liraglutide versus placebo, whereas reductions in 1-h gastric emptying of 23% with liraglutide 3.0 mg and 13% with 1.8 mg versus placebo were observed. Liraglutide 3.0 mg improved postprandial glycemia to a greater extent than liraglutide 1.8 mg. Liraglutide-induced weight loss appears to be mediated by reduced appetite and energy intake rather than increased EE. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","energy expenditure; energy intake; postprandial glucose; substrate oxidation; weight management","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Appetite; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gastric Emptying; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Satiation; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss; C peptide; carbon dioxide; glucagon; glucose; insulin; liraglutide; paracetamol; paracetamol 500pch; placebo; triacylglycerol lipase; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; liraglutide; adult; aged; appetite; area under the curve; article; blood sampling; body composition; body height; body mass; body weight; caloric intake; clinical article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; crossover procedure; decreased appetite; diastolic blood pressure; diet restriction; double blind procedure; drug absorption; drug dose comparison; drug withdrawal; energy balance; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; evening dosage; female; food intake; gas exchange; gastrointestinal disease; glucagon blood level; glucose blood level; glucose metabolism; glycemic control; heart rate; human; hunger; insulin blood level; insulin injection pen; male; maximum plasma concentration; meal; metabolic rate; nausea; needle; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; noradrenalin urine level; obesity; oxygen consumption; physical activity; postprandial state; priority journal; pulse rate; randomization; randomized controlled trial; respiratory quotient; resting energy expenditure; resting metabolic rate; risk assessment; satiety; side effect; single drug dose; sleeping energy expenditure; stomach emptying; systolic blood pressure; test meal; therapy effect; thirst; thrombosis; toe thrombosis; tooth infection; treatment duration; triacylglycerol lipase blood level; urinary excretion; visual analog scale; weight change; weight reduction; wellbeing; adolescent; analogs and derivatives; appetite; complication; drug effects; energy metabolism; middle aged; obesity; stomach emptying; treatment outcome","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902254986"

Methods: Twenty-six-week data from seven phase 3, randomized trials in the liraglutide T2DM development programme were analysed by trial and treatment group: liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8mg), active comparator and placebo. Outcome measures included proportions of subjects in various weight change categories and their percentage weight change from baseline; impact of body mass index (BMI) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) on weight change and correlation of weight change with change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Results: A number of subjects experienced >5% weight loss during the trials (24.4% liraglutide 1.8mg and 17.7% liraglutide 1.2mg; 17.7% exenatide, 10.0% sitagliptin, 3.6-7.0% sulphonylurea, 2.6% thiazolidinedione and 2.6% glargine; 9.9% placebo). More weight loss was seen with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8mg than with active comparators except exenatide. Across trials, higher initial BMI was associated with slightly greater weight loss with liraglutide. Mean weight loss increased slightly the longer GI AEs persisted. Although HbA1c reduction was slightly larger in higher weight loss categories across treatments (including placebo), sample sizes were small and no clear correlation could be determined. Liraglutide-treated subjects experienced additional HbA1c reduction beyond that which appeared weight induced; thus, not all HbA1c-lowering effect appears weight mediated. Conclusions: The majority of liraglutide-treated T2DM subjects experienced weight loss in this analysis. Weight loss was greater and occurred more in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist-treated subjects than in active comparator-treated subjects. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Exenatide; GLP-1; Liraglutide; Metabolism; Obesity; Weight","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; exendin 4; hemoglobin A1c; insulin glargine; liraglutide; placebo; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea; adult; adverse outcome; article; body mass; controlled study; diabetes control; drug safety; female; health program; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phase 3 clinical trial; randomized controlled trial; side effect; weight change","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871138624"

Candidates were identified from a search by Informa Healthcare including data available on TreasureTrove as provided by EOID. Additional information was sought using Google, PubMed, HighWire and ClinicalTrials.gov. Expert opinion: The summary of discontinued projects in this area for 2012 provides little in the way of specific guidance especially since details of the fate of most projects are often lacking. Nonetheless, it seems clear that none of these projects has hit upon the key aspects of the pathophysiology of the disorders that they were intended to treat, and the most likely cause of failure is the lack of the ability to produce compelling evidence to support the respective business case in the sense of efficacy/potential therapeutic profile. © Informa UK, Ltd.","Diabetes; Discontinued drugs; Obesity","Clinical Trials as Topic; Drugs, Investigational; Endocrine System Diseases; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Treatment Failure; aes 14; agi 006; ajd 101; antidiabetic agent; asp 4178; asp 5034; az 2066; azd 2423; bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist; chemokine receptor CCR2 antagonist; chemokine receptor CCR5 antagonist; crx 102; cytofab; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; dom 0200; dt 200; e 6014; eprotirome; fov 2304; g 100192; golotimod; ipragliflozin; kb 141; krp 104; krp 110; lipid; liraglutide; m 0002; metformin; methylsamidorphan; nkp 206; nn 8555; nn 9223; oap 189; pf 04634817; pf 04991532; pf 05212389; pf 3882845; pf 4136309; pf 50190457; placebo; placulumab; psn 821; psn 842; rg 4929; ruboxistaurin; rusalatide; sar 1 1099; semaglutide; sitagliptin; spd 556; sun 11031; ulimorelin; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; urotensin receptor antagonist; varespladib methyl; way 162545; anorexia; article; chronic wound; Crohn disease; diabetes mellitus; diabetic macular edema; diabetic nephropathy; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic retinopathy; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; endocrine disease; fracture; health care; human; inflammatory disease; information; kidney disease; liver disease; liver fibrosis; Medline; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pain; pathophysiology; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); psoriasis; rheumatoid arthritis; safety; somnolence; treatment withdrawal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884272264"

A total of 84 patients completed the trial who had been randomly assigned to either the liraglutide-added group or the insulin-increasing group while continuing current insulin based treatment. Insulin dose was reduced by 0-30% upon the initiation of liraglutide. Insulin doses were subsequently adjusted to optimized glycemic control. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values, blood glucose, total daily insulin dose, body weight, waist circumference, and the number of hypoglycemic events and adverse events were evaluated.Results: At the end of study, the mean reduction in HbA1c between the liraglutide-added group and the insulin-increasing group was not significantly different (1.9% vs. 1.77%, p>0.05). However, the percentage of subjects reaching the composite endpoint of HbA1c ≤ 7.0% with no weight gain and no hypoglycemia, was significantly higher in the liraglutide-added group than in the insulin-increasing group (67% vs. 19%, p<0.001). Add-on liraglutide treatment significantly reduced mean body weight (5.62 kg, p<0.01), waist circumference (5.70 cm, p<0.01), body mass index (BMI) (1.93 kg/m2, p<0.01) and daily total insulin dose (dropped by 66%) during 12-week treatment period, while all of these significantly increased with insulin increasing treatment. Add-on liraglutide treated patients had lower rate of hypoglycemic events and greater insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs discontinuation. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events in the liraglutide added treatment, but were transient.Conclusions: Addition of liraglutide to abdominally obese, insulin-treated patients led to improvement in glycemic control similar to that achieved by increasing insulin dosage, but with a lower daily dose of insulin and fewer hypoglycemic events. Adding liraglutide to insulin also induced a significant reduction in body weight and waist circumference.

Methods and results: Volunteers with prediabetes followed a calorie-restricted diet (-500Kcal/day) plus liraglutide (n=23) or placebo (n=27) for 14 weeks. The groups were similar in age (58±7 vs. 58±8 years) and body mass index (31.9±2.8 vs. 31.9±3.5kg/m2). A comprehensive lipid/lipoprotein profile was obtained before and after intervention using vertical auto profile (VAP). Weight loss was greater in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (6.9 vs. 3.3kg, p<0.001), as was the fall in fasting plasma glucose concentration (9.9mg/dL vs. 0.3mg/dL, p<0.001). VAP analysis revealed multiple improvements in lipid/lipoprotein metabolism in liraglutide-treated compared with placebo-treated volunteers, including decreases in concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and several of its subclasses, triglyceride, and non-high-density cholesterol. The liraglutide-treated group also had a significant shift away from small, dense low-density lipoprotein-particles, as well as decreases in apolipoprotein B concentration and ratio of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-1. There were no significant changes in the lipoprotein profile in the placebo-treated group. Conclusion: Treatment with liraglutide plus modest calorie restriction led to enhanced weight loss, a decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration, and improvement in multiple aspects of lipid/lipoprotein metabolism associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The significant clinical benefit associated with liraglutide-assisted weight loss in a group at high risk for CVD - obese/overweight individuals with prediabetes - as seen in our pilot study, suggests that this approach deserves further study. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cardiovascular disease; Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; Incretin treatment; Lipoprotein profile; Prediabetes","Aged; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoproteins B; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Caloric Restriction; Cholesterol, VLDL; Combined Modality Therapy; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Lipoprotein(a); Lipoproteins, HDL; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Overweight; Prediabetic State; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; high density lipoprotein; insulin; intermediate density lipoprotein; lipoprotein; liraglutide; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; antidiabetic agent; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose blood level; high density lipoprotein; lipoprotein A; liraglutide; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; body mass; body weight disorder; caloric intake; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; controlled study; diabetic obesity; diet restriction; drug dose increase; female; glucose blood level; human; impaired glucose tolerance; lipoprotein metabolism; male; middle aged; protein analysis; randomized controlled trial; waist circumference; aged; analogs and derivatives; blood; caloric restriction; diet therapy; metabolism; multimodality cancer therapy; obesity; Overweight; Prediabetic State","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920007637"

More recently, roles in energy expenditure and reward pathway modulation have been described. GLP-1 receptor agonism promotes insulin release and is currently used to treat type 2 diabetes humans, with a common side effect being weight loss. It is likely that many of these metabolic effects are mediated by GLP-1Rs located in the central nervous system, throughout areas known to be important in control of energy homeostasis. The physiological role of the GLP-1 receptor signalling in each of these brain nuclei is becoming clearer and the GLP-1 system appears to act as an integrator of peripheral energy availability and effector of metabolic regulation. This makes it an attractive target for obesity therapies, with excellent pre-clinical efficacy seen in molecules combining GLP-1 receptor agonism with glucagon receptor agonism. This review discusses what is known about the functions of the GLP-1 receptor in the central nervous system, and highlights the ways that this system may be targeted for development of new obesity therapeutics. © 2013 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.","Diabetes; Feeding; GLP-1; Metabolism; Obesity; Oxyntomodulin","Brain; Energy Metabolism; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Obesity; Receptors, Glucagon; Signal Transduction; alogliptin; exendin 4; furin; glicentin; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; glucagon like peptide 2; linagliptin; liraglutide; messenger RNA; oxyntomodulin; protein fos; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; STAT3 protein; vildagliptin; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon receptor; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor; article; blood brain barrier; clinical trial (topic); depolarization; energy expenditure; energy metabolism; food intake; gastrointestinal symptom; human; immunoreactivity; insulin release; nausea and vomiting; neurobiology; neuroendocrine system; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; priority journal; rhombencephalon; weight reduction; brain; energy metabolism; metabolism; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; signal transduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879139320"

It is a progressive disease which commonly requires multiple pharmacotherapy. Current options for treatment may have undesirable side effects (particularly weight gain and hypoglycaemia) and contraindications, and little effect on disease progression. Incretin based therapy is one of several newer therapies to improve glycaemia and is available in two different forms, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. Use of these agents results in a 'glucose-dependant' increase in insulin secretion and glucagon suppression resulting in improved glycaemia with low incidence of hypoglycaemia. DPP-4 inhibitors are oral drugs which are weight neutral, while GLP-1 agonists are injected subcutaneously and help promote weight loss while improving glycaemia. GLP-1 agonists have also been shown to increase beta cell mass in rat models. Bariatric surgery is another option for the obese patient with T2DM, with blood glucose normalizing in over half of the patients following surgery. Other therapies in development for the treatment of T2DM include sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, glucagon receptor antagonists, glucokinase activators and sirtuins. In this article, we will review the various existing and emerging treatment options for T2DM. © 2010 The Authors British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology.","DPP-4; GLP-1; HbA1c; Incretin; Type 2 diabetes","Animals; Bariatric Surgery; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Obesity; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; acarbose; alogliptin; antidiabetic agent; diltiazem; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; exendin 4; glibenclamide; glimepiride; glipizide; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; incretin; insulin; insulin glargine; ketoconazole; liraglutide; meglitinide; metformin; metformin plus sitagliptin; metformin plus vildagliptin; nateglinide; pioglitazone; repaglinide; rosiglitazone; saxagliptin; sergliflozin etabonate; sirtuin; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea; unindexed drug; vildagliptin; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis; add on therapy; anaphylaxis; angioneurotic edema; article; bariatric surgery; clinical trial; disease course; drug induced headache; fluid retention; fracture; glucose blood level; heart failure; heart infarction; hemorrhagic pancreatitis; human; hypoglycemia; insulin release; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreatitis; priority journal; rash; side effect; Stevens Johnson syndrome; treatment contraindication; upper respiratory tract infection; urinary tract infection; weight gain; weight reduction; agonists; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; metabolism; obesity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649305174"

Many treatment options exist, but achieving long-term glycemic control in patients with T2D remains challenging. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) offer a treatment option that improves glycemic control and reduces weight, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. They have emerged as attractive options for the treatment of T2D, and significant advances and developments continue to be published regarding these agents. To identify relevant literature on emerging issues related to GLP-1 RAs, a search of the MEDLINE database was performed. Studies published in English evaluating the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs were analyzed. Because of their advantages and unique mechanism of action, GLP-1 RAs are currently being studied in new clinical areas, including in combination with basal insulin, as adjunctive therapy in type 1 diabetes, and for weight loss. In addition, there are several emerging agents in development. Lixisenatide is a once-daily GLP-1 RA that targets postprandial glucose and may be most useful when added to basal insulin as an alternative to rapid-acting insulin. Albiglutide and dulaglutide are once-weekly GLP-1 RAs that may offer more convenient dosing. The most common adverse effects of all GLP-1 RA agents are gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), but the rates of occurrence vary among agents. Due to the differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy, rates of adverse effects, and administration requirements within the GLP-1 RA class, each agent should be evaluated independently. The future of GLP-1 RAs offers broader treatment options for T2D as well as potential in other treatment areas. © 2014 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","GLP-1 receptor agonist; type 2 diabetes","Anti-Obesity Agents; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drugs, Investigational; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Glucagon-Like Peptides; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments; Injections, Subcutaneous; Insulin; Peptides; Receptors, Glucagon; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Weight Loss; albiglutide; dulaglutide; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 2 receptor agonist; insulin; insulin aspart; insulin degludec; insulin degludec plus liraglutide; insulin glargine; insulin lispro; itca 650; liraglutide; lixisenatide; long acting drug; metformin; pioglitazone; placebo; semaglutide; short acting drug; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; antiobesity agent; dulaglutide; glucagon like peptide; glucagon like peptide 1; glucagon receptor; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor; hybrid protein; immunoglobulin Fc fragment; insulin; new drug; peptide; rGLP-1 protein; ZP10A peptide; antidiabetic activity; Article; constipation; diarrhea; drug approval; drug dose reduction; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug elimination; drug half life; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug response; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; dyspepsia; food and drug administration; gastrointestinal symptom; general device; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; hypersensitivity; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin release; insulin treatment; nausea; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pen device; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); systematic review; treatment duration; vomiting; weight reduction; adverse effects; analogs and derivatives; antagonists and inhibitors; chemically induced; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug administration; drug combination; drug effects; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; metabolism; subcutaneous drug administration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908877210"

Estimated national spending on direct costs related to these conditions exceeds $90 billion for overweight and obesity, $90 billion for diabetes, and $250 billion for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Spending on prescription drugs that are used to modify cardiometabolic risk (CMR) is both a major component of all spending on prescription drugs and a leading cause of the increase in such spending. Also, spending on antihyperglycemic agents is projected to become the largest single component of all spending on prescription drugs in the near future. As the use of antihyperglycemic agents continues to increase, there is a growing need to evaluate the relative and comparative cost-effectiveness of these products. As new antihyperglycemic agents appear, physicians and health plans may begin differentiating products in this category not only on the basis of their use in achieving glycemic control, but also in the context of their effect on global CMR factor modification. Objective: To describe the effect of overall CMR on clinical outcomes and costs in patients with diabetes. Summary: Metabolic syndrome is defined as a clustering of risk factors that identify those at increased risk of CVD and diabetes. Although the exact definition and clinical use of the term ""metabolic syndrome"" are debated, the clinical community is united in identifying its individual risk factors as important contributors to the development of cardiometabolic disease. Two of the most important points of consensus are that diabetes significantly increases the risk of CVD and that the CVD risk associated with metabolic syndrome is greater than the sum of its measured risk factors. Therefore, it is increasingly recognized that the risk of CVD is greater in patients with diabetes and other CMR factors than in those with diabetes alone. Diabetes treatment goals extend beyond glycemic control to include other risk factor modifications, such as blood pressure control, lipid management, weight management, and smoking cessation. However, a significant percentage of patients do not reach their treatment targets. To improve the quality of diabetes care, treatment algorithms have been developed to provide specific recommendations for each line of treatment and to suggest prompt reevaluation. Also, new antihyperglycemic agents, such as incretin-related therapies, have the potential to address the unmet needs associated with conventional antihyperglycemic agents, including the improvement of glycemic control with either weight maintenance or weight loss and the modification of CMR factors. Economic analyses demonstrate that CMR modification in patients with diabetes can reduce the costs of complications. Among chronic complications of diabetes, CVD treatment generates the greatest expenses, particularly in the early stages of disease progression. Health plan spending related to diabetes can be affected by a number of patient attributes, including age, glycemic control, complications, and CMR. It has also been shown that diabetes spending increases substantially in the presence of various CMR factors (e.g., obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemla), independent of the presence of other chronic complications. Increasing differences among antihyperglycemic agents have made apparent the need for models in cost-effectiveness analysis. Pharmaco-economic models have been developed and validated that simulate the treatment benefits not just of glycemic control, but of comprehensive diabetes management. These models can assist in demonstrating the importance of CMR modification in patients with diabetes. Conclusion: Growing evidence indicates that the evaluation of diabetes treatment strategies should incorporate considerations of their effect on global CMR. Macrovascular disease is one of the major factors in diabetes costs and resource use, both medical and pharmaceutical. Various economic analyses indicate that global CMR should be reduced to control costs in this population. Newer antihyperglycemic agents with a favorable overall metabolic profile may offer a cost-effective approach to managing diabetes. Copyright © 2008, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

The animal data behind this mechanism are inconsistent and the human histological data are preliminary and open to alternative explanations. Nevertheless, a cautious approach would seem reasonable • The single observational study in support of the hypothesis that GLP-1 based therapies cause pancreatitis is open to criticism and is not supported by other such observational studies • Results from studies involving adverse events reporting systems cannot be relied upon because of 'notoriety bias' • In the ABCD nationwide audits of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in real clinical use in the UK, use of these agents was associated with improvements in glycaemic control and weight and reduction in other diabetes therapies, in particular insulin. Alongside this there were very few reports of pancreatitis and 75% of these had an alternative explanation • GLP-1RAs reduce all the major risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) disease. Meta-analyses of existing randomised controlled trials involving DPP4 inhibitors suggest significant reductions in major CV events alongside no increase in pancreatitis or cancer. The eight, long-term, CV safety studies should clarify the issue with regard to risk and benefits of GLP-1 based therapies as they will record not only CV outcomes but also information on pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and thyroid cancer • The strength of the data in support of GLP-1 based therapies causing pancreatic damage does not justify the alarm that has been caused to patients taking these therapies. By stopping these agents in response to the scare that has been created, harm to patients may occur because of the discontinuation of the agents in whom they were working well • Pharmaceutical companies should make all relevant data available for inspection by independent experts.

Methods: The comparative effects of liraglutide, glimepiride and placebo on energy intake, appetite, nausea, gastric emptying, antral distension, bodyweight, gastrointestinal hormones, fasting plasma glucose and resting energy expenditure (REE), were assessed in subjects with T2DM randomised to treatment A (liraglutide-placebo), B (placebo-glimepiride) or C (glimepiride-liraglutide). Assessments were performed at the end of each 4-week treatment period. Results: Energy intake was less (NS) with liraglutide vs placebo and glimepiride, and 24-h REE was higher (NS) with liraglutide vs placebo and glimepiride. Fasting hunger was less (p=0.01) with liraglutide vs placebo and glimepiride, and meal duration was shorter with liraglutide (p=0.002) vs placebo.

Obesity-induced neurohumoral activation appears to be involved. The association between obesity and hypertension shows large inter-individual variability, likely through genetic mechanisms. Obesity affects overall cardiovascular and metabolic risk; yet, the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular risk is complex and not sufficiently addressed in clinical guidelines. The epidemiological observation that obesity may be protective in patients with established cardiovascular disease is difficult to translate into clinical experience and practice. Weight loss is often recommended as a means to lower blood pressure. However, current hypertension guidelines do not provide evidence-based guidance on how to institute weight loss. In fact, weight loss influences on blood pressure may be overestimated. Nevertheless, weight loss through bariatric surgery appears to decrease cardiovascular risk in severely obese patients. Eventually, most obese hypertensive patients will require antihypertensive medications. Data from large-scale studies with hard clinical endpoints on antihypertensive medications specifically addressing obese patients are lacking and the morbidity from the growing population of severely obese patients is poorly recognized or addressed. Because of their broad spectrum of beneficial effects, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are considered to be the most appropriate drugs for antihypertensive treatment of obese patients. Most obese hypertensive patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs. Finally, how to combine weight loss strategies and antihypertensive treatment to achieve an optimal clinical outcome is unresolved. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","bariatric surgery; cardiovascular risk; hypertension; neurohumoral; obesity; obesity paradox; treatment resistance","adrenergic receptor blocking agent; amlodipine; amlodipine plus benazepril; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antihypertensive agent; benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; carvedilol; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; isradipine; liraglutide; melanocortin; metoprolol; phentermine; rimonabant; sibutramine; spironolactone; tetrahydrolipstatin; thiazide diuretic agent; topiramate; adipose tissue; adrenergic receptor blocking; article; bariatric surgery; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure regulation; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial (topic); diabetes mellitus; disease association; edema; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart output; human; hypertension; insulin sensitivity; intraabdominal fat; kidney disease; lifestyle modification; linear regression analysis; lipid storage; low calory diet; low drug dose; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; pacemaker; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); primary medical care; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); renin angiotensin aldosterone system; resistant hypertension; sympathetic tone; waist circumference; weight reduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861068141"

This review evaluates the effects of antidiabetes therapies on weight and glycemic control in the type 2 diabetes mellitus population. A PubMed search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that reported the weight effects of antidiabetes treatments. The search focused on the newer incretin-based therapies, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. Antiobesity drugs and treatment options potentially available to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including bariatric surgery, were also examined. Most of the established antidiabetes therapies (eg, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones) promote weight gain, thereby exacerbating insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors exhibit a weight-neutral profile, however, and GLP-1 receptor agonists (eg, exenatide, liraglutide) have achieved significant body weight reductions in spite of improved glycemic control, which is often accompanied by weight gain. Antiobesity drugs, such as orlistat and sibutramine, are effective weight-lowering agents in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but safety and tolerability concerns may limit their use. Bariatric surgery in obese patients is associated with improved glycemic values and decreased mortality. Clinical evidence substantiating the weight-neutral effects of DPP-4 inhibitors and the weight-loss effects of GLP-1 agonists is promising, offering an expansion of therapeutic options for overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Evidence on the clinical utility of antiobesity drugs is more equivocal, and more data are needed to evaluate the safely and tolerability of these agents. © Postgraduate Medicine, a JTE Multimedia Company.","Amylin; Bariatric surgery; Diabetes mellitus, type 2; Exenatide; Liraglutide; Obesity; Orlistat; Rimonabant; Sibutramine; Sitagliptin; Vildagliptin","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Obesity; Weight Loss; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; amylin; antidiabetic agent; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; exendin 4; glucagon like peptide 1; incretin; insulin glargine; liraglutide; meglitinide; metformin; pioglitazone; placebo; pramlintide; ramipril; recombinant human insulin; rimonabant; rosiglitazone; sibutramine; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea; sulfonylurea derivative; tetrahydrolipstatin; vildagliptin; antidiabetic agent; abdominal pain; anxiety disorder; article; body weight; clinical trial; constipation; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; disease association; dizziness; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug use; drug withdrawal; evening dosage; fecal urgency; feces incontinence; gastrointestinal symptom; glucose intolerance; glycemic control; headache; heart arrhythmia; human; hypertension; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance; monotherapy; morning dosage; mortality; nausea; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; peripheral edema; rhinopharyngitis; side effect; suicidal ideation; tachycardia; upper respiratory tract infection; weight gain; weight reduction; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; review; weight reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-54049111104"

This is not due to lack of interest or research on the subject but rather to the poor efficacy and/or safety profile of the majority of the antiobesity drugs developed up to now. Since the late fifties, various medications were brought to advanced states of clinical development but either never made it to the market or were initially approved only to be withdrawn some years later because of safety issues. However, our understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity has been steadily increasing and new, promising drugs targeting various selected obesity-associated and energy-homeostasis-related pathways are now under development. Nonetheless, obesity remains a disease mainly caused by an excess of caloric intake in relation to energy expenditure and on that basis, its treatment should be a healthy diet and physical activity. When these options alone are not sufficient, then additional pharmacotherapy with an acceptable efficacy and safety profile could provide a useful option. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Antiobesity drugs; Body mass index; Obesity; Weight loss","Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Appetite Depressants; Combined Modality Therapy; Diet, Reducing; Drug Therapy, Combination; Evidence-Based Medicine; Exercise; Gastrointestinal Agents; Humans; Obesity; acyltransferase inhibitor; agouti related protein; amfebutamone; amfebutamone plus naltrexone; amfebutamone plus zonisamide; antiobesity agent; azd 7687; cetilistat; ecopipam; exendin 4; ezlopitant; gsk 598809; liraglutide; lorcaserin; metformin; metreleptin; mk 0557; naltrexone; obinepitide; pf 04620110; phentermine plus topiramate; pramlintide; recombinant leptin; sibutramine; tesofensine; tetrahydrolipstatin; ttp 435; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; velneperit; zonisamide; anticonvulsant activity; anxiety disorder; article; backache; caloric intake; cognitive defect; constipation; depression; diarrhea; dizziness; drug dose increase; drug induced disease; drug induced headache; drug safety; fatigue; hard feces; human; hypoglycemia; insomnia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; meta analysis (topic); monotherapy; nausea; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); physical activity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); rhinopharyngitis; seizure; skin irritation; somnolence; suicidal ideation; swelling; systematic review (topic); xerostomia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881350795"

GLP-1 analogue therapy considerably improves weight and glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes and its receptor is present on innate immune cells. Objective We aimed to determine the effect of liraglutide, a GLP-1 analogue, on psoriasis severity. Methods Before and after 10 weeks of liraglutide therapy (1.2 mg subcutaneously daily) we determined the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and the dermatology life quality index (DLQI) in seven people with both psoriasis and diabetes (median age 48 years, median body mass index 48.2 kg/m2). We also evaluated the immunomodulatory properties of liraglutide by measuring circulating lymphocyte subset numbers and monocyte cytokine production. Results Liraglutide therapy decreased the median PASI from 4.8 to 3.0 (P = 0.03) and the median DLQI from 6.0 to 2.0 (P = 0.03). Weight and glycaemic control improved significantly. Circulating invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells increased from 0.13% of T lymphocytes to 0.40% (P = 0.03). Liraglutide therapy also effected a non-significant 54% decrease in the proportion of circulating monocytes that produced tumour necrosis factor alpha (P = 0.07). Conclusion GLP-1 analogue therapy improves psoriasis severity, increases circulating iNKT cell number and modulates monocyte cytokine secretion. These effects may result from improvements in weight and glycaemic control as well as from direct immune effects of GLP-1 receptor activation. Prospective controlled trials of GLP-1 therapies are warranted, across all weight groups, in psoriasis patients with and without type 2 diabetes. © 2012 The Authors.

An extensive Medline, Cochrane database, and Embase search for exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, semaglutide, and lixisenatide was performed, collecting all randomized clinical trials on humans up to December 15, 2011, with a duration of at least 24 weeks, comparing GLP-1 receptor agonists with either placebo or active drugs. Twenty two (7,859 patients) and 7 (2,416 patients) trials with available results on body weight at 6 and 12 months, respectively, were included. When compared with placebo, GLP-1RAs determine a reduction of BMI at 6 months of -1.0 [-1.3; -0.6]kg/m2. Considering the average BMI at baseline (32.4kg/m) these data means a weight reduction of about 3% at 6 months. This result could seem modest from a clinical standpoint; however, it could be affected by many factors contributing to an underestimation of the effect of GLP-1RA on body weight, such as non adequate doses, inclusion criteria, efficacy of GLP-1RA on reducing glycosuria, and association to non-pharmacological interventions not specifically aimed to weight reduction.

NAFLD can progress to NASH, cirrhosis, and/or hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with increased mortality (2,6). Patients with NAFLD often present with few or no symptoms, and approximately two-thirds of patients have normal aminotransferase levels (13). Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose this condition. The presence of liver disease further complicates the treatment of T2DM. Patients with HI may be particularly prone to hypoglycemia, so agents with a low risk of hypoglycemia and minimal hepatic elimination should be used (1). Some agents, such as insulin, may be used in the presence of HI but require dose adjustment. Initial experience indicates that, in general, incretin-based therapies can be used in patients with T2DM and HI. Conversely, the presence of T2DM may affect the progression of NAFLD and NASH. At this time, lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone of treatment for NAFLD. However, several pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective in the treatment of NAFLD, although none are FDA approved. The incretin-based therapies GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors show promise in early clinical trials involving T2DM and NAFLD/ NASH.","","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; exendin 4; glibenclamide; glipizide; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; linagliptin; liraglutide; metformin; pioglitazone; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; sulfonylurea; apoptosis; article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body weight; cardiovascular disease; computer assisted tomography; disease course; ethnicity; fat content; glycemic control; Hispanic; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; insulin resistance; lactic acidosis; lifestyle modification; lipotoxicity; liver biopsy; liver cirrhosis; liver dysfunction; liver fibrosis; liver function; liver histology; meta analysis (topic); metabolic syndrome X; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; obesity; pathogenesis; prevalence; randomized controlled trial (topic); steatosis; ultrasound; weight reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-81155133233"

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted from the gut after meals and enhances glucose-induced insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion, suppresses appetite, and delays the gastric-emptying rate. GLP-1 analogs are already widely used in the adult population to improve glycemic control and induce weight loss in overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes. The glucose-lowering effects resulting from the inhibition of glucagon secretion and the gastric-emptying rate could be of clinical importance in type 1 diabetes. In this article we review clinical data regarding the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in youth and address the potential benefits and safety aspects of these compounds.

It comprises a disease spectrum ranging from simple steatosis (fatty liver), through non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to fat with fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. Simple steatosis is largely benign and non-progressive, whereas NASH, characterized by hepatocyte injury, inflammation and fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia and is now regarded as the liver manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Rapid spread of the obesity 'pandemic' in adults and children, coupled with the realisation that the outcomes of obesity-related liver disease are not entirely benign, has led to rapid growth in clinical and basic studies in NAFLD over the past decade.

The association between these metabolic disorders and the development of CVD is believed to be multifactorial, where insulin resistance, oxidative stress, low-grade inflammation and vascular maladaptation act as the major contributors. Therefore, multipronged therapeutic strategies should be taken for the management of patients with MetS. Lifestyle changes including weight control, healthy heart diet and regular exercises have been proposed as first line treatment to decrease CVD risks in MetS individuals. In addition, improving insulin resistance and glucose metabolism, controlling blood pressure as well as modulating dyslipidemia can also delay or reverse the progression of CVD in MetS. This review will first address the complicated interactions between MetS and CVD,followed by discussion about the optimal strategy in the prevention and treatment of CVD in MetS patients and the updated results from newly released clinical trials. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cardiovascular disease; Diabetes; Dyslipidemia; Insulin resistance; Metabolic syndrome; Obesity","Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Combined Modality Therapy; Endothelium, Vascular; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Life Style; Metabolic Syndrome X; anacetrapib; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; atenolol; atorvastatin; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; carvedilol; cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor; dalcetrapib; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; evacetrapib; exendin 4; fibric acid derivative; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; jjt 705; liraglutide; metformin; metoprolol; nebivolol; nicotinic acid; pioglitazone; rosiglitazone; sibutramine; sulfonylurea; telmisartan; tetrahydrolipstatin; thiazide diuretic agent; torcetrapib; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; abdominal obesity; antihypertensive therapy; article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; diabetes mellitus; drug dose comparison; dyslipidemia; enzyme activation; fluid retention; flushing; gastrointestinal disease; glucose metabolism; heart failure; hormone substitution; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin synthesis; ischemic heart disease; kidney failure; lifestyle modification; lipid metabolism; liver toxicity; metabolic syndrome X; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; pathophysiology; priority journal; rhabdomyolysis; side effect; weight control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881327164"

This lipocentric approach is integrated with analysis of inflammation associated with end-organ damage, including the vascular wall. Genes and proteins contributing to insulin resistance, β cell dysfunction and vascular wall damage have been identified. Transcription factors and coactivators, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator-1 are crucial in mediating insulin resistance and accelerating vascular wall inflammation, and represent promising therapeutic targets.

Research Methods and Procedures: Liraglutide was administered subcutaneously once daily (7 μg/kg for 7 weeks) to six female obese Göttingen minipigs. Food intake and feeding patterns were monitored using a novel automated feeding system that allowed continuous recording of food intake. Results: Food intake was strongly suppressed. A steady-state level of reduced food intake was achieved within 3 weeks and was maintained for the remaining 4 weeks of the treatment period. During the 4-week steady-state period with liraglutide treatment, daily food intake was 7.3 ± 0.3 megajoule (MJ) compared with 18.4 ± 0.6 MJ in the pre-treatment period and 19.2 ± 0.5 MJ in the post-treatment period (p < 0.001). The food intake in the treatment period was equivalent to the amount of food that would have been offered to normal-weight pigs for maintenance. Body weight decreased 4.3 ± 1.2 kg (4% to 5%) during the 7 weeks of treatment and increased 7.0 ± 1.0 kg during the 7 weeks of post-treatment (p < 0.01). Appetite suppression was quickly reversed within 4 days after termination of liraglutide administration. Discussion: Overall, liraglutide was well tolerated and had a profound and persistent anorectic effect that resulted in weight loss. These results, in conjunction with the previously established glucose-lowering efficacy of liraglutide, suggest that the anorectic actions of liraglutide will be very important in clinical trials of both obese patients with type 2 diabetes and obese non-diabetic patients.

Excessive weight gain worsens glycaemic control and increases cardiovascular risk. It can also increase diabetic morbidity and mortality if it acts as a psychological barrier to initiation or intensification of insulin therapy, or affects compliance. Insulin-associated weight gain might result from conservation of previously excreted glucose, defensive 'snacking' caused by fear or experience of hypoglycaemia, or the 'unphysiological' pharmacokinetic profiles that follow sc insulin administration. Strategies to limit insulin-mediated weight gain include increasing insulin sensitivity through dietary modification, exercise or insulin sensitising drugs. Attempts to replace insulin using regimens that accurately mimic physiological norms should also enable insulin to be dosed with maximum efficiency. The novel analogue insulin, detemir, has not shown the usual propensity for weight gain. Elucidation of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying this property could further clarify mechanisms linking insulin with weight regulation.","Diabetes mellitus; Insulin; Insulin detemir; Limiting weight gain; Mechanisms; Weight gain","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; albumin; amylin; fatty acid; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; hormone analog; insulin; insulin aspart; insulin detemir; insulin glargine; insulin lispro; insulin sensitizing agent; isophane insulin; liraglutide; metformin; myristic acid; placebo; pramlintide; sibutramine; tetrahydrolipstatin; unclassified drug; article; body weight disorder; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diet therapy; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; exercise; glucose blood level; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin sensitivity; insulin treatment; mental stress; morbidity; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; optimal drug dose; patient compliance; risk reduction; weight gain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-4444290077"

New antiobesity therapies are in development that target anabolic or catabolic regulatory networks to reduce food intake and/or increase energy expenditure to promote weight loss.","","Adiposity; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Body Weight; Cholecystokinin; Endocannabinoids; Energy Metabolism; Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; Humans; Leptin; Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormones; Neuropeptide Y; Obesity; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; Serotonin; Serotonin Agonists; Thyroid Hormones; 4 chloro n [[3 (4 chlorophenyl) 4 phenyl 2 pyrazolin 1 yl](methylamino)methylene]benzenesulfonamide; 5 (4 bromophenyl) 1 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 4 ethyl n (1 piperidyl) 1h pyrazole 3 carboxamide; ac 162352; anticonvulsive agent; apd 356; ave 1625; biovitrum; bupropion plus naltrexone; bupropion plus zonisamide; bvt 74316; cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabinoid receptor agonist; cannabinoid receptor antagonist; contrave; cp 945598; dopamine uptake inhibitor; excalia; leptin; liraglutide; lorcaserin; mk 0364; mk 0577; neuropeptide Y5 receptor; noradrenalin uptake inhibitor; peptide YY; phentermine plus topiramate; pramlintide; qnexa; rimonabant; s 2367; serotonin 2C agonist; serotonin 6 receptor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; v 24343; arcuate nucleus; article; body weight; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial; energy metabolism; homeostasis; human; hyperphagia; hypophagia; obesity; priority journal; protein secretion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247181123"

This disease is associated with defects in insulin secretion, specifically abnormalities of insulin secretory kinetics and pancreatic β-cell glucose responsiveness. Mechanisms underlying β-cell dysfunction include glucose toxicity, lipotoxicity and β-cell hyperactivity. Defects at various sites in β-cell signal transduction pathways contribute, but no single lesion can account for the common form of Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies highlight diverse β-cell actions of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). These intestinal hormones target the β-cell to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion through activation of protein kinase A and associated pathways. Both increase gene expression and proinsulin biosynthesis, protect against apoptosis and stimulate replication/neogenesis of β-cells. Incretin hormones therefore represent an exciting future multi-action solution to correct β-cell defect in Type 2 diabetes. ©2006 Biochemical Society.","Diabetes; Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1); Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP); Incretin hormone; Insulin; Pancreatic β-cell","Amino Acid Sequence; Antigens, CD26; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Food; Humans; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Molecular Sequence Data; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acarbose; biguanide derivative; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; exendin 4; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; incretin; insulin; liraglutide; ly 307161; meglitinide; miglitol; sulfonylurea derivative; apoptosis; article; cell division; cell function; cell stimulation; clinical trial; diet therapy; drug effect; enzyme activation; gene expression; hormone action; human; insulin release; insulin synthesis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; signal transduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33751306171"

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how sophisticated disease-based pharmacoeconomic models can aid formulary decision makers when long-term outcomes data are lacking. METHODS: The Center for Outcomes Research (CORE) Diabetes Model (CDM), a published, validated Markov pharmacoeconomic model that projects clinical and economic endpoints, was used to model the cost-effectiveness of exenatide, a new injectable antidiabetic agent that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, in a standard cohort of type 2 diabetes patients (mean body mass index [BMI] = 27.5 ± 3 kg/m 2), compared with a modified obese cohort (mean BMI = 35 ± 3 kg/m2) that was otherwise demographically identical at baseline to the standard cohort. The standard cohort was assumed to maintain baseline weight during treatment, and the modified obese cohort was assumed to experience weight loss of approximately 9% (mean = 3 kg/m2), with corresponding improvements in blood pressure, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We selected a 30-year time horizon because it was the time interval during which the CDM predicted most of the subjects would have died, and the costs obtained thus reasonably projected lifetime total direct medical costs for these cohorts. While treatment options certainly will change over a 30-year period, our goal was to estimate the incremental effect of exenatide over other available therapies. RESULTS: The model predicted reduced long-term treatment costs in obese patients, driven by an 11% decrease in cardiovascular disease burden and derived from the presumed weight loss. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for adding exenatide over 3 years was $35,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Using a 30-year horizon, ICER values were $13,000/QALY versus insulin, $32,000 versus generic glyburide, and $16,000 versus no additional treatment. Exenatide dominated pioglitazone. By comparison, the 30-year ICER for exenatide versus insulin in the nonobese cohort was $33,000. These results were presented to the pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) committee and influenced its decision to add exenatide to the drug formulary. While our modeling assumed certain patient characteristics (e.g., obesity, need of further A1c reduction at baseline, motivation to lose weight), the P&T committee imposed only a step-therapy requirement to try either metformin or a sulfonylurea before trying exenatide and did adopt a nonspecific requirement for physician reauthorization of refills before the fourth pharmacy claim for exenatide. CONCLUSIONS: Disease-based pharmacoeconomic models may help thirdparty payers project costs and be particularly useful when only data from short-term clinical trials are available. In the present case, the pharmacy staff of a health plan used a pharmacoeconomic model for drug treatment of type 2 diabetes provided by the manufacturer as part of the AMCP Format dossier process to project cost outcomes for exenatide, adjunct injectable therapy for patients taking metformin and/or sulfonylurea. The P&T committee approved the drug for inclusion in the drug formulary based in part on the results of the pharmacoeconomic model produced from the cost inputs entered into the model by the health plan pharmacists.

The present review describes the structural basis of the adipostat and hypothesise, which components may constitute available targets for pharmacotherapy of excess body weight. Hypothalamic neurones constitute the major components of the body weight homeostasis maintaining device. Together with neurones of the nucleus of the solitary tract, neurones of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus constitute the sensory components of the adipostat. The arcuate nucleus neurones respond to circulating levels of leptin and insulin, both of which reflect the levels of energy stored as triacylglycerol in adipocytes. The arcuate nucleus projects heavily to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Neurones of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus are hypothesised to constitute, at least partly, the adipostat motor pattern generator, which upon stimulation activates either net anabolic or catabolic physiological responses. The overall sensitivity of the adipostat is influenced by gain setting neurones hypothesised to be located in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area. Cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptides and pre-proglucagon derived peptides, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) are catabolic neurotransmitters synthesised in neurones of the arcuate nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract, respectively. The present review summarises the available evidence that both families of peptides constitute endogenous transmitters mediating satiety and touch upon potential pharmacological exploitation of this knowledge. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
